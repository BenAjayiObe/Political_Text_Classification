The provisions include implementing a penalty for those landlords who rent property to immigrants without leave in the UK, denying free access to most secondary healthcare in the UK to illegal immigrants, requiring banks to check against a database of known immigration offenders before opening accounts, introducing new powers to check the immigration status of applicants before issuing a driving licence and revoking the driving licences of those migrants who have overstayed, and introducing new powers to clamp down <br>on those trying to gain immigration advantage by entering into a sham marriage or civil partnership. <br><br>We have also used the Immigration Act to streamline the process of enforcing the removal of illegal migrants when necessary.

"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/100664/answer","Home Office","<p>Net migration statistics are produced by the independent Office for National Statistics (ONS). In line with the internationally agreed UN definition, these statistics define a migrant as someone changing their normal place of residence for more than a year. This includes students in net migration in the same way as other migrants. Other countries, including the United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand also include students in their net migration figures. <br><br>Net migration measures the difference between the number of peoplecoming the UK and the number leaving, so if students return home after<br>their studies, their impact on long-term net migration will be minimal. The ONS has recently improved its methodology so that it is possible to<br>better identify students in the emigration flows to give a more accurate measure of the contribution of students to overall net migration.In the last year, 124,000 non-EU students came to Britain to stay for more than 12 months, and the ONS estimates that only 50,000 left the country. <br><br>All migrants who are in the UK for 12 months or more have an impact on our communities, infrastructure and public services. Changing the way we measure migration would not make any difference to our student migration policy. There is no cap on the number of students who can come to the UK, and the county remains open to the brightest and the best.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p>","Biography information for James Brokenshire","Old Bexley and Sidcup","James Brokenshire","2014-11-05","211742"

My answer to your question on 28 April 2014 (Official Report, columns 443-444W) explained that, since the implications of the changes were recognised, no administrative action has been taken against service personnel who received a police caution that is immediately spent. We do not comment on individual complaints.</p>","Biography information for Anna Soubry","Broxtowe","Anna Soubry","2014-11-04","211772"
