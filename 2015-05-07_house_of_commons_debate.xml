      Ministers seem
to have discovered remarkable healing powers over the summer break.
They believe cutting benefits will help people in the work-related
group who have been assessed and deemed as being unable to work to
suddenly find work. It will give them an incentive, we are told. These
are people who have deteriorating conditions such as Parkinson’s
and MS which medical experts have said mean they will never be able to
work. Which medical condition would the Minister deem might be cured by
cutting benefits by £30 a

      On the contrary, this Government believe in
supporting people who are able to work to get back closer to the labour
market, and the Government spend about £350 million a year on
employment support for those with conditions, in particular disability.
I think all Members will be pleased to know that the Budget has also
provided new funding from April 2017 for additional support for
claimants with limited capability for work, but importantly the
principle here is that those who can work and are able to work are
supported by this Government in getting closer to the labour market,
and we are supporting them through our jobcentres and the initiatives
we have across
government.

      I thank my hon. Friend for his comments and, as he
mentions alternative therapies, I should add that this Government place
great emphasis on supporting 
benefit claimants with a range of conditions and that support can come
in the form of treatment such as talking therapies as well as valuable
support for those with mental health conditions. It is important to
continue to provide support for those who need help, and that is the
objective of this
Government.

      I wrote to the Secretary of
State over the summer following the news that his Department has been
publishing fake quotes which it attributed to benefit claimants who had
been sanctioned. As I am yet to receive a response, perhaps the
Secretary of State or his team could answer one of my questions today.
Has this practice of fabricating people and quotes been used by his
Department in other instances? If so, can he provide details of when,
and, if not, will he apologise to the British public for misleading
them and commit to ensuring the practice is never undertaken
again?

      The answer to the hon. Lady’s question is
very clear: that issue has been addressed and my right hon. Friend the
Secretary of State has made some very clear statements. I bring the
hon. Lady back to the overall question, which is about people with
deteriorating health conditions. This Government are committed to
supporting the vulnerable and have put in place a great deal of support
to help those with deteriorating health conditions manage their
conditions and, where they can, get back into

      Deteriorating
health is one of the main reasons why people are unable to work, but we
now know that about 90 people every month over the past three years
have died within a short time after having been assessed as fit for

      Let me be clear that the Department recently
published fully quality-assured age-standardised mortality statistics,
in line with Office for National Statistics requirements and to
national statistics standard. It is wrong to state that people have
died while claiming an out-of-work benefit and, for the record, it is
impossible and completely wrong to draw any causality from the
statistics. Any attempt to extrapolate anything beyond those figures is
wrong, and two national newspapers that tried to do that have just
published an apology for their incorrect reporting of the
statistics.

      I do think Ministers need to take their head
out of the sand, because it is clear that they are abdicating
responsibility for very sick people. It has  also emerged over
the summer that almost half the people appealing against sanction
decisions—more than 285,000 people—have been successful.
I suspect that a large proportion of those people have serious health
problems. Will the Minister finally listen to the cross-party calls for
a full-scale review of the sanctions regime and commit to that review
this afternoon?

      We have already had a review. Specifically with
regard to the statistics, the trend is that the number of people dying,
as a proportion of the population, is going down. I

      Of course, all claimants in the WRAG are assessed,
and that assessment determines that they should be in that group.
Importantly, people in that group who need more support to prepare for
work receive employment and support allowance. I emphasise that that
support helps them to prepare to go back to work, whether in the short
or medium term. Importantly, claimants are asked to participate in
activities that are both appropriate and reasonable for each individual
claimant.

      But 80,000 people who are not expected to get
better have been placed in the WRAG, including 8,000 with degenerative

Cutting £30 a week from such people’s benefit will not

      This is for

will be given support to prepare for a return to work in the short or

automatically deteriorate. Everyone who participates in that group will

      My hon. Friend does a huge amount of work in
her constituency to help people in those kinds of jobs and represents
them very well here. Jobcentres in her area are tasked with and focused
on helping people who do periodic work, which is the nature of a lot of
the employment there, and they are trained to do that. As universal
credit arrives next year, my hon. Friend will find that a huge number
of her constituents will benefit, because instead of losing their way
by having to come off jobseeker’s allowance and on to tax
credits, they will stay on universal credit and with the jobcentre.
That will help those who have work that is not always
permanent.

      My hon. Friend has been assiduous in his
work with the jobcentre and those who have been unemployed. Across the
country, long-term unemployment is down by more than a fifth, falling
to about 165,000 over the past year, and the number of
people unemployed for more than 24 months is falling. The latest
figures are down by a fifth, which is a remarkable position, given what
we took over from the last
Government.

      Obviously, this is a matter for my right
hon. Friends the Prime Minister and the Secretary of State for Northern
Ireland, but what I will say is that we have been in constant
discussions and negotiations with politicians in Northern Ireland about
implementing welfare reform. Even though there was agreement, they have
now decided not to agree. I simply say to all involved that they now
need to start thinking about how they can address the issue; otherwise,
they will not benefit the people they serve who will lose out because
they will lose

      My constituent, Mr Colin

at my constituency surgery just over a week ago in a very shaken and

personal independent payment reviewed. According to the

guidelines—

       Interruption.
      </I>
      <I>

      This is an
important issue. The guidelines state that cases involving claimants
with severe neurological conditions such as motor neurone disease,
dementia and Parkinson’s should be “paper based”
and not subject to interview. My constituent was subjected to very
intimidating behaviour and I would like the Secretary of State to look
very carefully at his case and, in a wider context, how people are
dealt with in such
situations.

      I know that the Secretary of

with disabilities back into work. Last week, I met representatives of
an access-to-work contractor, Pluss, which is very active in

      Yes. That is one of the objectives of this
Government. We have made huge strides in getting more people with
disabilities back into work—I think the figure is now over
220,000, which I believe is the highest figure since records began, in
proportionate terms—but the most important point is that we are
looking to get that up to the level of normal, non-disabled people who
are back in work. Those with disabilities have every right and every
reason to expect exactly the same support into work that everybody else
gets.

      Unemployment went up last month.
The Government’s commission on employment and skills pointed out
earlier this year that although we currently have German levels of
adult unemployment, we have eurozone levels of youth unemployment,
which went up in July and in August. Does the Secretary of State accept
that much more needs to be done to give young people the chance of a

      Of course we are focused on youth
unemployment, but it has actually been falling from what we inherited.
It has fallen by more than 200,000 since we took over, and
the claimant count has fallen every month in the past three and a half
years. The right hon. Gentleman talked about the figures going up, and
in a sense I am not surprised, because they cover the period leading up
to the last election. Given what the Opposition were saying, and
looking at the polls that some businesses carried out, it is no
surprise to me that they might have held back. If he looks at the
vacancies, he will see that there are 735,000 vacancies in the
jobcentres every week, which is more than he
managed.

      I do not agree with the hon. Gentleman when he says
that we are not taking our responsibility seriously. He will be aware
that Pension Wise offers free impartial guidance that can be given by
telephone, online or in face-to-face meetings, and that the Money
Advice Service provides a free directory with more than 2,250 firms
registered on it. That equates to more than 6,000 individuals who can
give advice. In Scotland, there are 162 firms that can give such advice
to people, so there are plenty of people out there, but if the hon.

      Is the Minister aware that
certain savers who have old, with-profits policies are being forced to
pay for financial advice and to get a sign-off, sometimes on an

      I am grateful to the Secretary of State for that
answer, but children growing up in households where the parents are on
the national minimum wage will see their household income cut next year
by up to a maximum of £1,426. He punched the air when the
announcement was made in the House in the Budget in July. Was he being

Chancellor announced one of the biggest rises in the living wage. I
make no apology for punching the air, because that was a huge

      We are not scrapping all the child poverty
targets; what we have said is that we are going to look at all the life
chances measures. We want to know what they are doing and how well they
are performing. Alongside that, we are still publishing income
measures; HBAI statistics—households below average
income—will still be published. The hon. Lady is therefore wrong
in what she says. What we are doing is focusing on what we can actually
do to help families get out of poverty, rather than rotating them
around a 60% median income line, as the last Labour Government did.
That did not make any sense and cost a huge amount of
money.

      Absolutely; that is exactly right. This is
about the measures we take that keep people out of poverty in a
sustained way. I have talked already about the rise in the national
living wage, but we are also doubling free childcare to 30 hours a
week; raising educational standards; and expanding successfully the
troubled families programme to a further 400,000 families. In addition,
the early years pupil premium is hugely important in helping the most

      We inherited a situation where nearly one in
five households in Britain had nobody in work at all. It is far more
likely for someone who is out of work to be in poverty and for their
children to be in poverty. We have pretty nearly halved that level and
have the lowest number of workless households since records
began.

      Until a few weeks ago, the
Secretary of State told us that he was committed to the targets in the
Child Poverty Act 2010, but now he has brought forward legislation that
not only scraps those targets, but, as my hon. Friend the Member for
Cardiff Central (Jo Stevens) pointed out, will leave Ministers with no
child poverty targets at all. He has just denied that from the Dispatch
Box, but the fact is that the Welfare Reform and Work Bill removes all
the child poverty targets. Why are the Government, in reality, despite
his fine words, throwing in the towel on child
poverty?

      We are not; we are committed to eradicating
child poverty and we will have to report every year on our achievement
in line with the figures 
that I gave the right hon. Gentleman earlier. I simply say to him that
his Government failed to meet their targets—they spent
£75 billion on tax credits in their last six years and still
failed—and it is under this Government, in the past five years,
that child poverty has actually fallen by some 300,000, rather than
under them.

      The truth is that child poverty is now going to
rise even faster than already predicted because of the huge cuts in tax
credits next April, to which my hon. Friend the Member for Eltham
(Clive Efford) referred. With most children in poverty now living in
working households, not workless households, should the Secretary of
State’s children’s life chances reports not include data
on children in low-income working households, as well as on those in
workless households?

      I believe that our reports will cover a much
wider range of issues that affect child poverty. I have always felt
that issues to do with family stability, drug and alcohol addiction and
education are critical to a child achieving a decent outcome. If the
right hon. Gentleman has anything further to add, I am always willing
to take his submissions, and the Select Committee has also said that it
will do the same. My point is that an arbitrary target simply for an
income line, which is what his Government did, leads to a huge
distortion in the benefits system, and the right hon. Member for
Birkenhead (Frank Field) has said exactly the same.

the new pension freedoms which show that people with big pots are

      Let me be absolutely clear: this Government will not
dictate what anybody should do with their pension pots. What we have
put in place is the means by which people—both men and
women—can seek advice. As I mentioned earlier, there is the
Money Advice Service, which has on its books more than 2,250 firms
across the country that can give advice. It is for people to take that
advice and then to decide. We will not dictate how people should deal

      Universal credit is now available in more than
half of jobcentres across Great Britain and will be available in all
jobcentres early next year. The national roll-out is on track and our
“test and learn” approach is now working very well.
Nearly 175,000 people have made a claim for universal credit
so far. The number is growing exponentially as we roll out the scheme
across the country. Our evidence shows that universal credit
claimants find work quicker, stay in work longer and earn more than the
jobseeker’s allowance
claimants.

      It would be helpful if the hon. Lady
listened to the answer that she was given rather than go with a Labour
Whip’s handout. The Front-Bench team obviously worked very hard
to ensure that she got her question in. Universal credit is going to be
a remarkable success; it is rolling out to more than half of jobcentres
and people will benefit enormously.

      In contrast to the views expressed by the hon.
Member for Blackburn (Kate Hollern), in my constituency of Boston and
Skegness I am told that the roll-out of universal
credit is progressing well in its limited form,
thanks in part to all the agencies involved. Will the Secretary of

      I can give my hon. Friend that assurance. In
all the areas in which we have rolled out universal credit—in
more than half of jobcentres—it is dramatically improving
people’s lives. Unlike when the previous Government rolled out
tax credit and hundreds of thousands of people lost their money, this
scheme is ensuring that people who deserve the money and are ready for
it are paid it.

      The number of people receiving
universal credit remains derisorily small. Four years ago, the
Secretary of State told us that the transition to universal credit
would be complete by 2017. We told him he would not manage it. We were
right; he was wrong. He still has not given us a revised date for the
completion of universal credit roll-out. Has he given up entirely on
ever having one?

      I am on the verge of giving up speaking to
the right hon. Gentleman, because he misuses all the facts. As I have
told him again and again and again, he is more than welcome to visit
the sites where it has been rolled out. He has had an open invitation
to come to see the digital site and I recommend that he does so.
Universal credit is already working; no one has lost any money; it will
be online; and it will go out fully and start next year. This is a
successful programme and if the right hon. Gentleman wants to compare
notes about tax credit roll-outs, I would be more than happy to do
that.

      As I have already said, universal credit is
now available in more than half the jobcentres. The full development
starts rolling out next year. People will benefit enormously not just
from the technicalities but from the fact that an adviser will now stay
with a claimant all the way through the claim. I know that my hon.

      Contrary to the Minister’s earlier remarks,
figures finally released by the Department over the summer showed that
2,380 people died after being declared fit for work—more than
four times the death rate of the general population. In a harrowing
case, a constituent of mine reported to me that she frequently
considered committing suicide, both before and after being found fit
for work. Does the Minister not feel that it is therefore high time to
review the work capability assessment and that thousands of people are
being wrongly defined as fit for
work?

      Once again let me say that any attempt to
extrapolate anything from those figures is simply wrong. It is
impossible to draw any causality from those statistics. Organisations
have commented on this and Full Fact, which is widely known, has said
that similar comments to those made by the hon. Lady, which have been

young people should not slip into a life on benefits. The Department

nearly 4,000 new apprenticeship starts since 2010 in my constituency,

notwithstanding the Government’s well-known track record on
apprenticeships and the number of people across the country who have
benefited from our apprenticeship scheme, the subject was discussed at

Cheshire Disability, along with many other organisations, does to help
young disabled people take up employment. The Under-Secretary of State
for Work and Pensions, my hon. Friend the Member for North Swindon

      My hon. Friend is right. For a start, all young
people are screened at the beginning of their claim process to identify
any barriers and the kind of support they need. Importantly, we provide

      The hon. Gentleman makes a very valid point, and he
is right that this is about supporting individuals. The Government have
a raft of measures, schemes and initiatives to support young people.
For those who face certain challenges, such as autism, we are working
with employers to help them provide those young people with
opportunities for sustained employment. 
We have many programmes, such as Access to Work, which specifically
support individuals who face challenges in the workplace. We are
developing our relationships with employers so that more and more of
them are coming on board to support young people in having fulfilling
careers.

      This Government are absolutely committed to
supporting young people. Bridging the gap between school and the world
of work can be challenging. Our policies and measures across
Government—not just in the Department for Work and Pensions, but
in the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills and the
Department for Education—fully support that transition.
Importantly, the DWP is about to roll out a Jobcentre Plus programme in
schools, and we are also doing much more with employers to support the
transition into the world of
work.

      As one who has employed someone with a mental
health condition, I know the importance of keeping people in work.
People with mental health conditions account for 20% of long-term
absentees, so in December 2014 we launched the Fit for Work scheme,
which helps to tackle sickness absence by providing an occupational
health assessment and health and work advice to employees and,
crucially, employers. That is particularly important to the smaller
businesses that provide 47% of private sector jobs. Also, through the
Access to Work scheme, our dedicated team of advisers have helped
record numbers of people—more than 1,600 last
year.

people with mental health problems are sanctioned every day. Every one
of those sanctions reduces the confidence of a person with mental

      Over the past year, sanctions fell by 40%.
Jobseekers are only asked to meet reasonable requirements, taking into
account their circumstances and capability, including mental health
conditions, disability and caring responsibilities. Sanctions are not
imposed if a jobseeker has good reason for failing to meet those
requirements. Also, jobseekers can always ask for decisions to be

      My hon. Friend is right: nearly 2
million more people take home a pay packet that is increasing, up 2.8%
on the year, and for the last nine consecutive months, the increase in
pay has outstripped inflation. Even better, my right hon. Friend the
Chancellor has announced a huge rise in take-home pay through the
national living wage, and we should all welcome
that.

      This month, we are rolling out our Fit for Work
programme to all employers across England and Wales, and to GPs.
Employers will now be able to refer thousands of workers facing
long-term sickness to specialist support, providing occupational health
advice and helping them to avoid long absence. The Fit for Work service
is the first line of defence when anyone falls sick, and alongside GPs
it will help employers to avoid people falling on to sickness benefits
and losing their link with the world of
work.

      Actually, that has not happened. Taxpayers
have not lost money. What we have done is to go on rolling out a
system, and unlike what happened when tax credits were rolled out under
the last Labour Government and hundreds of thousands of people lost
money, nobody is losing money as universal credit rolls
out.

      My hon. Friend is correct. This Government have had
a very strong track record in supporting young people in getting back
into work. As I said earlier, this area was
discussed at the recent G20. We have now joined an international
commitment to do even more because we are ambitious for our young
people. We have agreed to have a target for doing more by reducing the
number of NEETs by 15% by 2025. We are committed to that. She will be
interested to know that our international counterparts are also
interested in what the United Kingdom has done and achieved.

      There are rules, regulations and
guidance on who should be sanctioned. The sanctions regime, which was
in place under the Labour Government, is there to ensure that when
taxpayers pay their money 
to support unemployed people, those people look for work, take that work
and stay in work. I think that is only
fair.

aid budget to alleviate poverty and suffering in the countries from
which these people are coming. We are the only major country in the
world that has kept the promise to spend 0.7% of our GDP on aid. We are
already the second largest bilateral donor of aid to the Syrian
conflict, including by providing more than 18 million food rations,
giving 1.6 million people access to clean water and providing education
to a quarter of a million children. Last week, we announced a further
£100 million, taking our total contribution to over £1
billion. That is the UK’s largest ever response to a
humanitarian
crisis.

      Some
£60 million of the additional funding will help Syrians who are
still in Syria. The rest will go to neighbouring
countries—Turkey, Jordan and Lebanon—where Syrian
refugees now account for a quarter of the population. More than half of
the new funding will support children, with a particular priority
placed on those who have been orphaned or separated from their
families. No other European country has come close to this level of
support. Without Britain’s aid to the camps, the numbers
attempting the dangerous journey to Europe would be very much
higher.

      As
my right hon. Friend the Chancellor said yesterday, we will now go much
further in the spending review, significantly reshaping the way we use
our aid budget to

hold much larger sums in reserve to respond to acute humanitarian

      Turning
to the question of refugees, Britain already works with the UN to
deliver resettlement programmes and we will accept thousands more under

      However,
given the scale of the crisis and the suffering of the Syrian people,
it is right that we should do much more. We are proposing that Britain
should resettle up to 20,000 Syrian refugees over the rest of this
Parliament. In doing so, we will continue to show the world that this
is a country of extraordinary compassion, always standing up for our
values and helping those in need. Britain will play its part alongside
our European partners, but because we are not part

      We
will continue with our approach of taking refugees from the camps, and
from elsewhere in Turkey, Jordan and Lebanon. This provides refugees
with a more direct and safe route to the United Kingdom, rather than
risking the hazardous journey to Europe, which has tragically cost so
many lives. We will continue to use the established United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees process for identifying and resettling
refugees. When they arrive here we will grant them a five-year
humanitarian protection visa, and we will significantly expand the
criteria we use for our existing Syrian vulnerable persons relocation
scheme. As we do so, we will recognise that children have been
particularly badly affected by the crisis in Syria. In most cases, the
interests of children are best met in the region where they can remain
close to surviving family members, but in cases where the advice of the
UNHCR is that their needs should be met by resettlement here in the UK,
we will ensure that vulnerable children, including orphans, will be a
priority.

      In recent

      Turning to our
national security, I would like to update the House on action taken
this summer to protect our country from a terrorist attack. With the
rise of ISIL, we know terrorist threats to our country are growing. In
2014, there were 15 ISIL-related attacks around the world. This year,
there have already been 150 such attacks, including the appalling
tragedies in Tunisia in which 31 Britons lost their lives. I can tell
the House that our police and security services have stopped at least
six different attempts to attack the UK in the past 12 months
alone.

      The threat
picture facing Britain in terms of Islamist extremist violence is more
acute today than ever before. In stepping up our response to meet this
threat, we have developed a comprehensive counter-terrorism strategy
that seeks to prevent and disrupt plots against this country at every
stage. It includes new powers to stop suspects travelling. It includes
powers to enable our police and security services to apply for stronger
locational constraints on those in the UK who pose a risk. It addresses
the root cause of the threat—the poisonous ideology of Islamist
extremism—by taking on all forms of extremism, not just violent
extremism.

      We have
pursued Islamist terrorists through the courts and the criminal justice
system. Since 2010, more than 800 people have been arrested and 140
successfully prosecuted. Our approach includes acting overseas to
tackle the threat at source, with British aircraft delivering nearly
300 air strikes over Iraq. Our airborne intelligence and surveillance
assets have assisted our coalition partners with their operations over
Syria. As part of this counter-terrorism strategy, as I have said
before, if there is a direct threat to the British people and we are
able to stop it by taking immediate action, then, as Prime Minister, I
will always be prepared to take that action. That is the case whether
the threat is emanating from Libya, from Syria or from anywhere
else.

      In recent
weeks it has been reported that two ISIL fighters of British
nationality, who had been plotting attacks against the UK and other
countries, have been killed in air strikes. Both Junaid Hussain and
Reyaad Khan were British nationals based in Syria and were involved in
actively recruiting ISIL sympathisers and seeking to orchestrate
specific and barbaric attacks against the west, including directing a
number of planned terrorist attacks right here in Britain, such as
plots to attack high-profile public commemorations, including those

      We should be
under no illusion; their intention was the murder of British citizens,
so on this occasion we ourselves took action. Today, I can inform the
House that in an act of self-defence and after meticulous planning,
Reyaad Khan was killed in a precision airstrike carried out on 21
August by an RAF remotely piloted aircraft while he was travelling in a
vehicle in the area of Raqqa in Syria. In addition to Reyaad Khan, who
was the target of the strike, two ISIL associates were also killed, one
of whom, Ruhul Amin, has been identified as a UK national. They were
ISIL fighters, and I can confirm that there were no civilian
casualties.

      We took this
action because there was no alternative. In this area, there is no
Government we can work with; we have no military on the ground to
detain those preparing plots; and there was nothing to suggest that
Reyaad Khan would ever leave Syria or desist from
his  
desire to murder us at home, so we had no way of preventing his planned
attacks on our country without taking direct
action. The US Administration have also confirmed
that Junaid Hussain was killed in an American airstrike on 24 August in
Raqqa.

      With these
issues of national security and with current prosecutions ongoing, the
House will appreciate that there are limits on the details I can
provide. However, let me set out for the House the legal basis for the
action we took, the processes we followed and the implications of this
action for our wider strategy in countering the threat from ISIL.
First, I am clear that the action we took was entirely lawful. The
Attorney General was consulted and was clear that there would be a
clear legal basis for action in international law. We were exercising
the UK’s inherent right to self-defence. There was clear
evidence of these individuals planning and directing armed attacks
against the UK. These were part of a series of actual and foiled
attempts to attack the UK and our allies, and given the prevailing
circumstances in Syria, the airstrike was the only feasible means of
effectively disrupting the attacks that had been planned and directed.
It was therefore necessary and proportionate for the individual
self-defence of the United Kingdom. The United Nations charter requires
members to inform the President of the Security Council of activity
conducted in self-defence, and today the UK permanent representative
will write to the President to do just
that.

      Our
intelligence agencies identified the direct threat to the UK from this
individual and informed me and other senior Ministers of that threat.
At a meeting of the most senior members of the National Security
Council, we agreed that should the right opportunity arise, military
action should be taken. The Attorney General attended the meeting and
confirmed that there was a legal basis for action. On that basis, the
Defence Secretary authorised the operation. The strike was conducted
according to specific military rules of engagement, which always comply
with international law and the principles of proportionality and
military necessity. The military assessed the target location and chose
the optimum time to minimise the risk of civilian casualties. This was
a very sensitive operation to prevent a very real threat to our
country, and I have come to the House today to explain in detail what
has happened and to answer questions about it.

      I want to be
clear that the strike was not part of coalition military action against
ISIL in Syria; it was a targeted strike to deal with a clear, credible
and specific terrorist threat to our country at home. The position with
regard to the wider conflict with ISIL in Syria has not changed. As the
House knows, I believe there is a strong case for the UK taking part in
airstrikes as part of the international coalition to target ISIL in
Syria, as well as Iraq, and I believe that that case only grows
stronger with the growing number of terrorist plots being directed or
inspired by ISIL’s core leadership in Raqqa. However, I have
been absolutely clear that the Government will
return to the House for a separate vote if we propose to join coalition
strikes in Syria.

      My first duty
as Prime Minister is to keep the British people safe. That is what I
will always do. There was a terrorist directing murder on our streets

the aftermath of a terrorist attack on our streets and have to explain
to the House why I did not take the chance to prevent it when I could
have done. That is why I believe our approach is right. I

      I thank the
Prime Minister for his statement and I shall start by asking about the
refugee crisis. When a country decides how to respond to the plight of
others from outside, it is a moment when a nation becomes clear about
who it is and what it stands for. This is one such defining moment. Is
our national priority to keep people out at all costs or to give
sanctuary to those fleeing from their homes? Is being British to be
narrow, inward looking and fearful of the outside world or is it about
being strong, confident and proud to reach out to those seeking refuge
on our shores? It must be the
latter.

      We
should not be talking about refugees as being “a burden”
on us. Among the Syrian children we take in now will be the future
consultants at our hospital bedsides, the entrepreneurs who will build
our economy, the professors in our universities and those who will be
among the strongest upholders of British values, because that has been
the story of refugees to this country—whether it be the Jewish
children of the Kindertransport, the Asian families driven out of east
Africa 20 years later or the Sierra Leoneans fleeing a brutal civil
war. The Prime Minister said last week that it will not help to take
more refugees because it will not solve the problem in Syria, but that
was a false choice. Helping those Jewish children was not part of our
efforts to end the second world war; helping the east African families
did not bring down the brutal dictatorships in east Africa, but it was
the right thing to do.

      I shall not
take up any more time rehearsing the criticisms of the
Government’s response to date, but I want to ask the Prime
Minister about what is going to be done now. He said that this country
will now accept 20,000 Syrian refugees over the course of this
Parliament. How many will it be this year? The crisis is immediate so
does that mean there will be only 4,000 this year? We need more
information on that. Will the Prime Minister now urgently convene local
authority leaders from around the country to hear from them what they
are prepared and able to do to settle the refugees into their areas and
how much further they can go? Many local authorities are keen to step
forward and play their part—and that is greatly to their credit.
They will need additional resources, particularly at a time when they
are undergoing unprecedented cuts. The Government have said that they
are planning to use the international aid budget for this purpose. Is
that compliant with our commitment to 0.7%, and why does the Prime
Minister not use the reserves for this
purpose?

      It
is not just a matter of immediate resettlement; there is also
integration. Will the Prime Minister establish and publish a proper
integration plan? The refugee 
crisis is not an issue only for local government or the Home Office; it
is an issue for the Department for Transport, the Department for
Education, the Department of Health, the Department for Business,
Innovation and Skills and for the devolved authorities of Scotland and
Wales. What discussions has the Prime Minister had with the First

      Desperate
conditions in the refugee camps are what drive many of those who risk
their lives trying to bring their families to Europe. We strongly
support our aid already provided to the refugee camps in Jordan,
Lebanon and Turkey, but it remains a concern that the Prime Minister is
not co-ordinating his response more broadly with other European
countries or with the UN. Will he reconsider his refusal to take any
refugees from the southern European countries where most refugees have
arrived? Fifty thousand have come to Greece in the course of just one
month, and these refugees, too, need help.

      It is clear
that Europe has been overwhelmed and is without a plan so will the
Prime Minister call for an emergency summit of EU leaders? We have a
lot to learn from those countries that have already embarked on the
process of resettling refugees, so will he join me in thanking Dame
Glenis Willmott, MEP, for ensuring that this will be debated in the
European Parliament this

because the man was planning and directing armed attacks in the United
Kingdom, there was no other way of stopping him, and the action was
necessary and proportionate. Bearing in mind that the sufficiency of
evidence in relation to each of those points is crucial to the
justification for that action, why did the Attorney General not
authorise the specific action, rather than merely confirming that
“there was a legal basis” for it? Was the Attorney

the threat based on a specific act that he was plotting? Will the Prime
Minister tell the House whether this action by our military was an
isolated action, or is he saying that the Government are likely to
repeat action of this sort in the future? Above all, will he agree with
me that there is a need for independent scrutiny of what the Government

      We
are already engaged in the use of force against ISIL in Iraq, and it is
vital for the United Kingdom to continue to play its part in
international efforts to combat ISIL across the region. The Prime
Minister said in his statement that if he proposed joining coalition
strikes in Syria, he would return to the House for a vote of
authorisation. May I reiterate the position as set out by the shadow
Defence Secretary and me on 2 July? ISIL brutalises people, it murders
people, and it is horrifically oppressive. We will carefully consider
any proposals that the Government present in relation to military
action in Syria, but we all need to be clear about what difference any
action would make to our objective of defeating ISIL, and about the
nature of such action, its objectives, and the legal basis. Potential
action must command the support of other nations in the region,
including Iraq and the coalition that is already taking action in
Syria.

      I thank the right hon. and learned Lady
for her response. I agree with her about the contribution that refugees
who have come to Britain have made to our country. I am thinking of
Jewish refugees from Europe, and of the Ugandan Asians who have made an
immense contribution to our country, and I know that these people will
do so as well.

      I also agree
with the right hon. and learned Lady that, as I said, there is not a
number of refugees that we can take that will solve the problem of
Syria. This is about meeting our humanitarian responsibilities, and
demonstrating that ours is a country—which it is—with a
moral conscience and a moral way in the world, which is why it is one
of the countries that are not only taking refugees, but meeting their
aid targets in a way that other major countries are not.

      The right hon.
and learned Lady asked about the 20,000 and how many we can take in
this year. Obviously we want to get on with this process. It will
depend in part on how well UNHCR can do in processing people in the
camps to come to the UK. Checks obviously have to be made on the people
we will be receiving. We also want to work, as she says, very closely
with local authorities so that the capacity to not just receive people,
but receive them well, is in place. She asked about the aid budget and
whether we were going to stick to the rules. Yes, we are. The aid rules
are explicit: we can use the 
money in the first year receiving refugees. That makes common sense,
apart from anything else, so we will use that
money.

      The
right hon. and learned Lady asked for an integration plan. The Home
Secretary and Communities and Local Government Secretary will chair a
committee to bring together Government, so that we make sure we do
everything we can to help people across the country, and they will be
looking at that issue of integration. Have we discussed this issue with
First Ministers in Wales and Scotland? Yes, there has been contact. The
First Minister in Scotland has made a generous offer, wanting to take,
I think, 1,000 refugees into Scotland. With this 20,000 figure, that
will probably rise, and I welcome what the Scottish National party is
saying about
that.

      The
right hon. and learned Lady asked about European co-operation. I have
just got off the telephone to Angela Merkel; she was very grateful and
welcomed the statement we are making today, but let me make this point,
because it is important: Britain has a major role to play in terms of
this conflict because we are the second biggest funder of these refugee
camps, and we are the biggest donor of aid to many of these countries.
We will be taking 20,000 refugees, but we think it makes more sense to
take the refugees from the refugee camps, rather than those
redistributed within Europe. Obviously countries within the Schengen
no-border system have a different set of responses, and we will work
with them, and it is important that we show solidarity as we do so. We
want to encourage people not to make that dangerous crossing in the
first place, and it is worth considering this: 11 million have been
pushed out of their home in Syria, and so far only perhaps 3% have made
that journey to Europe, so it is important that as we act with head and
heart, we help people without encouraging them to make that dangerous
and potentially lethal
journey.

      The
right hon. and learned Lady asked about an emergency summit. Britain,
France and Germany called for an emergency meeting of Home Affairs and
Justice Ministers, which will take place on 14 September. We will be
meeting as well in October, and if there is a need for further
meetings, we can look at that, but what is needed overall in Europe is
a comprehensive plan—not just for the number of refugees, but
for dealing with the external border, making sure other countries meet
their aid obligations and stopping the criminal
gangs.

      Let
me turn to the right hon. and learned Lady’s questions on
counter-terrorism. She asked: is this the first time in modern times
that a British asset has been used to conduct a strike in a country
where we are not involved in a war? The answer to that is yes. Of
course, Britain has used remotely piloted aircraft in Iraq and
Afghanistan, but this is a new departure, and that is why I thought it
was important to come to the House and explain why I think it is
necessary and
justified.

      The
right hon. and learned Lady asked about the legal justification. She is
right to say that we believe it was necessary and proportionate, and
there was no other way we could have met our objectives, and all this
was based on the Attorney General’s advice. We do not publish
the Attorney General’s advice, but I am very happy to discuss
the content of that advice and describe what it was about, which was
largely self-defence. She asked whether the Attorney General should
take the 
responsibility for carrying out these strikes. I do not think that is
the right person to carry it out. I think the way we did this is right:
with a meeting of senior national security Ministers, it being
authorised by that group, and the operational details being left with
the Defence Secretary, in line with what the Attorney General said. A
proper process was
followed.

      The
right hon. and learned Lady asked what was different about this person
and this case. There was a relatively unique set of
circumstances—which is not to say that they will not happen
again—in that these people were in a part of Syria where there
was no Government, no one to work with, and no other way of addressing
this threat. The choice we were left with was to either think,
“This is too difficult,” throw up our arms and walk away
and wait for the chaos and terrorism to hit Britain, or take the action
in the national interest and neutralise this threat, and I am sure that
was the right thing to do. She asked if we would repeat this. If it is
necessary to safeguard the United Kingdom and to act in self-defence,
and there are no other ways of doing that, then yes, I
would.

question. I have come here today because I think it is important to be

scrutinised in the coming months and

      Finally,
the right hon. and learned Lady talked about whether we should combat
ISIL in Syria, as we do in Iraq. The question for the House is whether,
if it is right to degrade and defeat ISIL in Iraq, in time it is surely
right for us to assist in the efforts already under way to defeat and
degrade ISIL in Syria. There are complications and difficulties, and I
do not want to come back to the House until we have debated the matter
more and people have had the chance to make their views known, but I am
in no doubt that ISIL and its operatives are a clear and present danger
to the United Kingdom, and the sooner they are defeated and eradicated,
the
better.

Britain’s membership of the European Union? Does he agree that
the flows start through Turkey and Libya, after which people come
across the continent towards Britain, which is one of the more popular

are doing work in the Syrian refugee camps: 10 times more money is

can some priority be given to not just Christians, but the Yazidis, who

      My hon. Friend makes an important point.
In drawing up the criteria, we will be looking at the people who are
the most vulnerable, and there is growing evidence that some people are
vulnerable not only within Syria but within the refugee camps
themselves, so Yazidis, Christians and others—particularly
children or women at risk of abuse—will all be in our
scheme.

      There is perhaps a sad
inevitability about the news that my former constituent Reyaad Khan has
been killed, having joined ISIL, but I think that the House will have
been surprised to learn that the manner of his death was a drone strike
against a British citizen in Syria. There will therefore be many
questions that Members will want to ask, and that I as his constituency
MP and members of his family will want to ask. In the light of the
action that the Prime Minister has outlined to the House today, I would
like an assurance that he will be as forthcoming as possible, given the
security situation, in explaining the nature of the threat that this
21-year-old man posed to the United
Kingdom.

question and for the way in which he put it. Of course I will be as
forthcoming as I possibly can be. I have been forthcoming in this
statement, and I will be in future statements, but I am restricted
because of operational sensitivities and for reasons of national
security. The police will have informed his former constituent’s
family of what has happened. I would simply say that when we are
dealing with people who are producing such a tempo of potential
terrorist attacks—attacks on police and on members of the armed
services, attempted attacks on commemorations in our
country—which the head of MI5 describes as having no recent
comparator, we have to take action. When we are dealing with people in
ISIL-dominated Syria—there is no Government, there are no troops
on the ground—there is no other way of dealing with them than
the route that we took. I think that, for all those reasons, it was the
right route.

      I commend the Prime
Minister’s emphasis on taking those who are in the Syrian camps.
If we are genuinely to help refugees, this cannot simply be about
helping the fittest, the fastest and those most able to get to western
Europe. We must help those who are left behind in the camps, who are
sometimes the most vulnerable. I ask him to go further, however, and to
enable the United Kingdom to spearhead international efforts to create
safe zones in  
Syria, so that those who are caught between the barbarity of Assad and
the depravity of ISIL do not feel the need to flee their own country in
the first
place.

for his support for taking people from the camps. We have
looked at the issue of safe zones, and we will continue to do so, but
if we are going to designate safe zones, we have to ensure that they
are safe. That would involve a military commitment by Turkey, by
America and potentially by Britain, and it would be a very significant
commitment. We should focus on what the safe zones are supposed to
achieve, which is to try to keep people in their homes and communities
or, when they have left, to keep them in refugee camps rather than see
them making the dangerous crossing into Europe. The thinking about safe
zones is certainly the right sort of
thinking.

      I
recognise and welcome the change in Government policy in recent days
and weeks. The Prime Minister might no longer be describing refugees as
a “swarm”, but there is still a lot that he could be
doing to catch up with public opinion here. We should not be raiding
our international development budget to pay for this, we should not be
restricting our help to those who are currently in the country, and we
should not be resisting efforts to build a common EU position. The
people of Britain do not want to see the human misery of hundreds of
thousands of people being used as a political football; they want a
non-partisan approach. May I therefore suggest that the Prime Minister
convene a summit of the leadership of all the parties represented in
this House, so that we can construct a policy for the reaction to this
crisis that will unite our country rather than divide
it?

the Department for International Development budget. It is an
acceptable existing use of that budget to pay for refugees in their
first year after coming to Britain, and that is good common sense. I
will resist, though only partly, the temptation to point out that,
according to my Sunday papers, the Liberal Democrats want to cut the
aid budget. But there we are; perhaps I will leave that one for the

      The right hon.
Gentleman talks about a common European position. Yes, we should be
working towards a comprehensive approach, but we are not in the
Schengen no-borders agreement, and I think that being able to maintain
our border controls when others in Europe have given theirs up is right
for Britain. I also think it is right to take the refugees out of the
refugee camps rather than take part in the relocation scheme, which
always has the danger of encouraging more people to get into boats, get
into dinghies and make the potentially lethal crossing across the
Mediterranean.

      For every drowned
baby we see on television there are many more in the rubble of Syrian
cities unseen, and for every refugee we take there are many more who
want to come, too. Given that the only long-term solution is to
re-establish 
functioning nation states in the region, will the Prime Minister not
accept that aerial bombardment can have only a partial effect and that
this needs a much greater and wider international approach to trying to
solve the problem at source? What discussions are now unfolding among
other Prime Ministers and Presidents to try to do more than just stick
Elastoplast on this continuing and growing

      My right hon. Friend is entirely right
that what is required, whether in Iraq or, more crucially now, in
Syria, is functioning Governments that can represent all their people,
with armed forces that have the confidence of all their people. That is
the long-term answer in both Iraq and Syria, but we are a long way from
that in Syria. He asked what conversations are going on. Conversations
are going on to try to secure a transition in Syria from the totally
unacceptable regime we have today, which is the recruiting sergeant for
ISIL, to a regime that can represent all the Syrian people, but he is
right.

      The offer of 20,000
refugees over five years amounts to just 12 refugees a day,
which falls pitifully short of what is needed and of what people in
this country deserve and expect. Local authorities such as Brighton and
Hove’s would be very willing to accept more, provided the
Government fully resource this. Will the Prime Minister therefore
guarantee the funds—not from the aid budget—and,

The 0.7% commitment is not some sort of badge to take out and wear; it
is something that is making a real difference. The reason why we have
been able to be the second largest bilateral donor to the Syrian
refugee camps is that the resources are available—as I have
said, I am talking about giving 10 times more than some other major
European countries. This morning I met Stephen O’Brien, formerly
a Member of this House and now UN Under-Secretary-General with

They need money for food and for proper resources. There is a crying

promises that we have
made.

      The point about the migration target is
that the Office for National Statistics has calculated migration
figures in the same way for many, many years. It includes refugees as
well as other migrants. I think the British public wants to know that
the system as a whole—for migration and for those seeking
asylum  
—is under control. I am absolutely clear that we are committed to
taking 20,000 Syrian refugees, and we will meet that
target.

      My hon. Friend the Member for
Reigate (Crispin Blunt) was quite right to emphasise the World Food
Programme and the fact that many other European countries have simply
not subscribed enough. The website for the World Food Programme
demonstrates that the United Kingdom has given twice as much as Germany
over the past year and 45% more than Germany over the past five years.
Perhaps that is something the Prime Minister would like to take up with
Angela
Merkel.

      My right hon. Friend makes an important
point. There are a number of people who are fleeing the appalling
conflicts for whom we need to find a home, but clearly there are people
who have been crossing the Mediterranean—particularly those
coming from Libya on the central Mediterranean route—who are
economic migrants in search of a better life. Part of the comprehensive
approach that Europe needs is to ensure that there is a way of breaking
the link between getting on a boat in Libya and getting settlement
rights 
in Europe. Going back through history, whenever countries have had huge
problems in this regard, they have needed to break that link to
discourage people from making the trip if they are not
refugees.

      We do not believe it is right to take part
in the European relocation quota because we think that a better answer
for Britain, which is such a major investor in the refugee camps, is to
take people directly from the camps. In that way we will not encourage
more people to make this perilous journey. By taking a long-term view,
and looking at the asylum seekers we have taken and the people we have
resettled from around the world, I would say Britain is absolutely
fulfilling our moral responsibility, and we absolutely play our
part.

      In terms of
the hon. Gentleman’s question about Iran, of course there is an
opportunity for greater dialogue with Iran now that this nuclear deal,

Iran is still a supporter of terrorist organisations like Hamas and
Hezbollah, which I know he describes as friends but which I see very
much as enemies. We also need to make sure that Iran is playing a
positive role in Syria, rather than the role it plays now of propping

Friends the Members for Sutton Coldfield (Mr Mitchell) and
for North Somerset (Dr Fox) have both raised the possibility of safe
havens in Syria itself to stem the flow of refugees at source. If this
is to work, it would require a United Nations mandate, which would
require the support of Russia. Do the Government recognise that
remaining fixated on removing Assad puts a bar on any solution of this
sort? Will the Government make up their mind that the main threat to
our interest is Daesh? If so, we can then proceed to have a genuinely
international coalition and agreement against that main
threat.

Friend’s views, but on this occasion I do not agree with him on
two grounds. I do not think it is right to look at Syria and say that
we have to choose between 
ISIL or Assad. It would be a great mistake to think that because Assad
is perhaps the lesser of two evils we should back him. Assad is one of
the chief recruiting sergeants for ISIL because of the butchery of his
own people. I do not think there is a workable proposal for safe havens
as things stand today, but it has been possible in past times to
intervene in that way to try to keep people safe. If you were acting to
try to alleviate a humanitarian emergency, you could act in that way,
but the problem is that safe havens would require a large military
intervention, and a large military intervention that I do not currently
believe is the right answer.

hon. Friend the Member for New Forest East (Dr Lewis) is
absolutely right that if we are to deliver a comprehensive solution,
which is what the Prime Minister has called for, we need to resolve the
problem in Syria. Unless we engage with Russia, which has made it
crystal clear that it will not resile from its support for Assad, and
get everyone around the table—regional leaders, the Americans
and ourselves—we will not be able to do that. I commend the
Prime Minister. He has a job to do, and I think that he will do it

careful in this regard, because many expert groups advise that there is
a danger in potentially taking children away from other family members
and groups, but I am sure that there are many orphaned children and
children at risk whom we could welcome here. We have also looked at
Save the Children’s proposal about the 3,000 Syrian children
already here in Europe, and we will continue to discuss that. Again,
major international organisations such as the UNHCR advise caution on
relocating unaccompanied children, so we should be guided by the
evidence as we make these very difficult
decisions.

      In view of the crisis
over the past few weeks, should not Germany be warmly congratulated on
its act of humanity? In many respects, Germany has acted as the
conscience of the European Union, and indeed of Europe as a whole. When
the right hon. Gentleman next meets the Hungarian Prime
Minister—no doubt he will—will he express our contempt
for the remarks made by that creature and tell him that what is
required is humanity and that it does not matter a damn whether the
people who are trying to save their lives and their children’s
lives are Muslim or not, because that is totally

unique outpouring of sympathy, tempered with horror, from the
nation—well articulated, if I may say so, by the shadow Home

One of the ways to make sure that the criminal gangs do not benefit is
to take people out of the camps, rather than take people who have
arrived in Europe, because, tragically, many of them are being
inveigled into using criminal gangs, which benefit when the trade in

      I welcome the Prime

with him that direct recruitment should be from the camps; however,
there will be exceptional cases of people who have arrived in mainland
Europe, some of whom I have met in Calais, who have ties with the
United Kingdom and who may need to be processed. Will he look at those
cases? In particular, will he please stress to the EU the need to
support Europol? That is the organisation best placed to deal with the
criminal gangs and Daesh, and we should give it more

      The right hon. Gentleman is absolutely
right about Europol, and we are putting in investment and working very
closely with it. We are also putting National Crime Agency officials
into the operations in Sicily and elsewhere to break up the criminal
gangs. I would be very cautious, however, about his suggestion about
Calais. Anything that suggests that Calais will become a processing
centre for people to come to the United Kingdom would simply make the
situation there worse. We need to explain to people that coming to
Calais and trying to get through the tunnel is not the way to get to
the United Kingdom. That is what all the security and the defences are
about, and we should keep them
up.

      The Prime Minister has said
that Britain will take in 20,000 refugees over the next five years, but
he has paradoxically said that we will not accept them as
refugees—they will not be given refugee status. He said
they would be given status as being under
humanitarian protection. As he knows, that is a discretionary leave to
remain that does not entitle them to settlement. These are people who
desperately need security and stability in their lives. How is he going

      That is a very good question. There are
two reasons for taking this approach. One is that by granting people
the humanitarian passport, as it were, they do not formally have to go
through asylum procedures to prove that they are refugees; we are
taking them once they have met the criteria, and then they have the
right to stay. Of course, at the end of those five years some may
choose to return to Syria, but many will want to stay here and apply
for settlement rights, which of course they will be able to

      We are funding the camps in Jordan, in
Lebanon and in Turkey. The point I am trying to make about the 11
million is that, given that so far only 3% of the 11 million have moved
to Europe, we have to be careful not to create an incentive so that
that 3% becomes 10% or 20%, because that would completely overwhelm the
capacity of even the most generous state, such as Germany, to receive
people. That is why investing in the refugee camps and not just helping
those in the camps outside Syria but working with UN agencies about how
to help people inside Syria, which I was discussing with Stephen
O’Brien this morning, is so important in trying not only to stop
the scale of the movement but to save lives at the same
time.

      May I remind
the Prime Minister that many of us in the Chamber are quite closely
linked through our ancestry to migrants and refugees? In my case, my
Huguenot Protestant ancestors were hounded out of France by the
Catholics. Most of us in the Chamber will come from that sort of
background. Should we not build on the generosity of spirit that has
been shown by the British people? I do not think that the Prime
Minister has yet gone far enough. I hope that he will go further. All
of us must realise that none of us has clean hands and many of us are
so responsible for the instability in the middle east that caused this
problem in the first
place.

that the British public are very generous and want to see us resettle

      The facts of the matter are that
those refugees who have made it into the EU are already safe and we
cannot make them any safer. Not all those coming in are genuine
refugees. We are already taking hundreds of thousands of migrants into
the UK every year and we are struggling to cope with them. I have not
heard anybody ask that they should be distributed around the rest of
the EU through a quota system. May I therefore urge the Prime Minister
to have regard to the silent majority in this country and base 
his decisions on common sense and being practical,  not on the
affliction of so many other politicians,  which is some kind of
emotional craving to be seen as compassionate, irrespective of the
practicalities of the

      It is ironic that it has taken
a photograph of one little boy washed up on a beach to focus world
attention. This has been going on for months if not years: thousands of
people have already drowned, but that one little boy has certainly
focused attention. Our response, while welcome, is insufficient. One
person in my constituency rang up today as I was driving up in the car
and said, “I’ve got places for 20 families.” My
local authority, which is  
a poor local authority, has already offered places for 20
families. That little boy came from Kobane, which was liberated by
Syrian and Iraqi Kurds, not by us, and that little boy’s father
has gone back to Kobane. We owe such people something more. It is this
country’s individuals who have shown the way,
and I would hope that the Government will
follow.

      The
second point I would make is that Britain’s generosity on this
issue did not start five minutes, five days or five weeks ago. Our
generosity started with our decision to pursue 0.7% of GDP for aid,
even at a time of austerity, and our decision to be the second largest
bilateral aid donor to those Syrian refugee camps—beaten only by
the United States of America. We give more than Germany, more than

      My hon. Friend is absolutely right. It is
difficult to get precise figures, but a number of people have left
Syria because of Assad’s brutality and a number of people have
left because of ISIL’s brutality. That is why the movement of
refugees has been so great and why it is wrong to say that we need to
choose between two evils. We need to get rid of both of
them.

      I congratulate my

national interest. It is a shame that Her Majesty’s Opposition
did not take a similar approach when Syria was debated on a substantive
motion two years ago, when their behaviour was duplicitous, and that is
being charitable. May I take him back to the tragedy within this
humanitarian disaster that is the systematic persecution of Christians
over many years? Notwithstanding his earlier answers, in designing
the

the systematic persecution of Christians that has

      I think that we have an obligation to act
in a way that will reduce the pressure on these people and that will
further our national interests and make us more safe. We therefore have
to debate and discuss in this House not only how many refugees we
should take and what we are doing in terms of humanitarian aid, but
what we can do to help degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL. There is no

what we are doing in Iraq is right, it is right that we support the

      My hon. and learned Friend makes an
important point. Giving someone asylum and refugee status is not an act
that is just completed with a piece of paper; it has to be completed
with a warm welcome. We have to say to these people, “You will
be welcome in our communities. Your children will be welcome at our

      The Prime Minister must
be aware that there has been a sharp rise in crimes against Muslims and
in anti-Muslim sentiment in the UK and Europe. Will he, as Prime
Minister of this country, assure me that religion will not be a
criterion to grant humanitarian relief? Will he resist the temptation
to use the term “Islamic terrorism”? It is not Islamic.
It is just pure terrorism.

      The hon. Lady is absolutely right that we
should not take people on the basis of their faith, but on the basis of
whether they are being persecuted. I describe it as “extremist
Islamist terrorism” because I think simply to say that what we
are facing from ISIL and others is terrorism is not a proper
description of what we are facing. The religion of Islam is a religion
of peace. The overwhelming majority of Muslims want to
condemn—and do daily condemn—these fanatics, but the fact
is that the fanatics themselves self-identify as Muslims. That is why
it is so important that British Muslim communities—as they
do—stand up and condemn them and say, “You are not acting
in the name of our great religion. You are perverting it.” But
simply pretending the problem does not exist by just calling it
terrorism will not work.

      I can certainly give that assurance. The
scale of movement of people into Lebanon, for instance, now accounts
for about a quarter of its population. We give a lot of money to that
country to help with refugees and we should continue to do so. It is

      My right hon. and learned Friend makes an

recommitted to 2% throughout this decade, meaning a real-terms increase
in our defence budget, and I believe that an important part of that

      The
Prime Minister rightly said that he did not want people making these
dangerous crossings of the Mediterranean. The Swedish academic
Professor Hans Rosling has identified an EU aviation directive that is
forcing such crossings to happen, at four times the cost of flying,
helping criminal gangs to grow and creating the risk of drowning, as we
saw with that young boy last week. Will the Prime Minister consider the
possibility at the EU level of suspending that directive for a while on
the routes people are using so that they do not have to risk their
lives making these
crossings?

      We have said 20,000 refugees, which I
think is the right response for Britain. We want to make sure we have
the capacity to give these people a home and a welcome. Obviously,
every year Britain takes asylum seekers from right around the
world—I think last year we had some 25,000 applications. We have
a large number of people from Eritrea and other countries trying to
make their way to Britain and claim asylum. Our record on asylum claims
over a 10 to 20-year period shows that we are a generous country which
operates the system properly, and I think that 20,000 Syrian refugees
is about right.

      The British people are indeed, as the Prime Minister said, a generous
people, and they will find his proposal for taking 4,000 Syrian
refugees a year derisory, but above all, long after this refugee crisis
is no longer on the front pages, there will be a need for a
sustainable, Europe-wide strategy. It cannot be right for Greece and
Italy to be left alone to deal with incoming migrants from across the
Mediterranean. It cannot be right that we refuse to take our quota.
Syrian refugees are not the only issue; migrants from the horn of
Africa and north Africa are drowning in the Mediterranean every day.
The Prime Minister needs to look to a more sustainable strategy that is
more genuinely about working closely with our European neighbours,
because hundreds of thousands of lives depend on
it.

20,000 Syrian refugees is the right response for Britain. While I agree

      My right hon. Friend’s
decision to spread the 20,000 refugees over the lifetime of this
Parliament seems to me a sensible one, but it does not come without
risks—namely, the opportunity for those who wish our country ill
to infiltrate the camps to see if they, too, can get themselves to the
UK under this programme. Will the Prime Minister assure the House and
the country that robust but sensitive vetting and security procedures,
where appropriate, will be in place from day one until the
end?

      Constraints mean that I will have
to park questions about the deployment of lethal force against a UK
citizen in order to address the refugee crisis. The Prime Minister
talked about supporting these refugees in their hour of need, but how
does that 
rhetoric chime with admitting only 20,000 over the course of five years,
with overtones of disqualification for those who have already made
perilous journeys and perhaps lost loved ones? Will the Prime Minister
go further than merely have his Ministers having disparate
conversations with First Ministers and will he, along with the Irish
Government, convene a special meeting of the British-Irish Council
properly to co-ordinate the response for refugees across all the
Administrations of these islands, taking account of their different
service models, and to offer good partnership to international agencies
and domestic charities that want to
help?

      My hon. Friend is absolutely right. The
aid budget is there to help the most vulnerable, the weak and the
poorest in our world, and that should include the first-year costs of
people to whom our country is giving refuge and asylum. Yes, we will go
on making sure—this will be part of the spending

      In a few
weeks’ time, it will be the first anniversary of the murder of
my constituent, Alan Henning, by ISIL. Alan gave his life to get vital
aid through to Syrian children, but as we saw last week, Syrian
children are still in desperate need of refuge and support. It is in
respect of the scale and lack of immediacy of the Government’s
response today that my constituents in Eccles and Worsley will be
disappointed. They want to see a more immediate response and a more
generous offer to Syrian refugees. Will the Prime Minister think
again?

      In the 1990s, families in
Darlington welcomed Bosnian refugees into their homes, and it
is a credit to them that they are willing to
welcome refugees again. Our voluntary sector is already collecting toys
and clothes. Those people know what to do, and the
local authority is on board. What they do not know—they are
trying to plan, and the success of the scheme will be greatly assisted
by an ability to plan properly—is when this is going to happen.
They have no idea when it will happen. The Prime Minister said
“straightaway”, but we need more than
“straightaway”. We need to know whether the Prime
Minister is talking about days or weeks. What does he

      My hon. Friend is right. In order to solve
the problem, we need to see an end to ISIL in Iraq and Syria. This is a
terrorist state: it is a state that terrorises its people, that throws
gay people off buildings, that terrorises women. No wonder people are
fleeing from it. It is unthinkable, in my view, that we will ever see a
solution to the problems in Syria and Iraq while ISIL still exists. The
role that we are playing at the moment is that of helping those who are
taking direct military action, while providing military action in Iraq,
but of course we must discuss and debate in the House whether we are to
go
further.

      Does the Prime Minister agree
that there are great advantages to both local communities and refugees
if they are located evenly and proportionately throughout the kingdom?
Does he know that in the fine city of Newport, we successfully host 459
asylum seekers and Cardiff has more than 900, but the constituency of
the Chancellor has only two, the Home Secretary has only five and the
Prime Minister has none? How many of the 20,000 will be located to his

      There has been a lot
of debate this afternoon about the numbers, and rightly so because, to
maintain the good

right. I am interested in the how and the when. How can we feed in

      During the summer I
visited the British Red Cross office in Glasgow. A constituent who is a
Syrian refugee, has a brother in Athens with kidney failure. He needed
to go to Athens and the Home Office granted asylum after
representations from me. That serves to highlight the fact that in this

      We are engaging. Our decision to take
20,000 people and our immense funding of the refugee camps will take
the pressure off other European countries. I am not conflating those
two things. Those who are part of Schengen have taken away all
their  
internal border controls across Europe and they maintain their external
border, so obviously the Schengen countries have to come together to
work out what they are going to do about this migration crisis. We can
be part of that—we help to fund Frontex and to secure the
external border, and we are helping to break up the criminal
gangs —but we have not decided to take our borders down,
as they have, so we are not in the same position. I am not conflating
the two; this is a really important

“I simply felt I couldn’t vote for this action against
Assad and chemical weapons because of what happened over Iraq.”
I totally understand that, but we have now got to get over that and
recognise that it is in our interests as a country for ISIL to be
degraded and ultimately destroyed. We are playing a proud part, but I
would like us to do more. Let us separate this from the issue of the

      I can certainly give the hon. Lady that
assurance. The Gateway programme, which she talks about, and other
schemes effectively resettle about 1,000 people in Britain every year.
In addition there are successful asylum applications—I think
there were 11,000 last year—and we will now be taking 20,000
Syrian refugees. I think that is a generous, compassionate country in
action, and we look forward to working with Hull City Council on that

      The ability to move in Europe and take a
job is something that many of our own citizens enjoy by going to live
in another country. What we should be addressing is the additional pull
factor of our welfare system, which can give people some €12,000

would ensure that free movement works, which is important, but is not

only six refugees per constituency per year, or a total of 30 per

      By announcing
that their borders are open to all the migrants who can get to them,
Germany and Sweden have inadvertently increased the demand for
migration 
across a continent and increased the human misery. Will the Prime
Minister assure the House that the UK will not make that mistake and
that we will not do the wrong thing, even if it is for the right
reasons?

      When the Prime Minister
started speaking, I felt really proud that Britain was going to take
20,000, but then we were told that it would be over five years and I
have to say that my heart sank. The local council in my constituency of
Bridgend has said that, despite £50 million in cuts over five
years, it will take in 10 families. Many of these families cannot wait
five years for us to offer them a home. Their need is now. Why cannot
we move the 20,000, start taking people now and have a regular
statement from the Prime Minister telling us how many have come so that
we can get a sense of movement and take our 20,000, certainly before
five years is
up?

      It is worrying that the Prime
Minister is using a crisis situation to announce a major reshaping of
aid policy, which many people would say should meet humanitarian need
rather than a narrow definition of national interest. In confirming
that the use of aid will meet current OECD guidelines, will he also
tell us what thought he has already given to providing support outside
of the aid budget and beyond the first 12 months of
resettlement?

      I believe that 20,000 Syrian refugees is a
generous and correct figure for Britain. What we should do now is get
on with it and move as rapidly as we can to process those people. It
takes time because we have to work with the UNHCR to go through those
in the camps and find suitable people to come here. It also takes time
to work with local councils. I do not want to make a pledge that we
then cannot deliver properly on the ground, and I believe that this
20,000 pledge can be delivered
properly.

and justify it to its Parliament and its people. I do think that the
money we spend in Syrian refugee camps is hugely important, because it

      The mark of a
civilised society is the way in which it deals with a humanitarian
crisis. All of us have had full postbags over the past few weeks as
people have reflected on the human misery and suffering that have taken
place, and people in my constituency will reflect on the paucity of the
response from the United Kingdom. When we see Germany taking in 10,000
refugees a day, talking about taking 20,000 people over five years is
inexcusable. This Government should be ashamed of themselves. We have
talked about the capacity to take people in. What is this

      The Prime Minister
said that the thinking on safe havens was the “right sort of
thinking”. On 28 November 2011, I asked the then Secretary of
State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs whether we could have safe
havens in Syria for the protection of civilians. He replied that there
was no “imminent plan” for such safe havens. Why did we
not push harder for safe havens at that time? Which countries objected
to them? And what is the timeline for the present plan for safe havens
that would allow people to be protected on their doorstep from Assad
and from
Daesh?

      Let me be clear about what I was saying; I
do not want to mislead anybody. I said that the thinking about safe
havens was the “right sort of thinking”, because it is
addressed at trying to help people in the region, rather than
encouraging them to travel. The problem with safe havens up to
now—it is still a problem—is that if we are going to
declare somewhere a safe haven, it must be safe. Our experience in
Bosnia and elsewhere is very relevant here. To make the haven safe, we
would have to commit a lot of troops and, potentially, air support to
take out Syrian air defences. A whole series of steps would have to be
taken, and we are a long way away from that. The only point I was
trying to make 
was to show some sympathy with those people who are pursuing the idea of
safe havens, because they are at least trying to help people in the
region, rather than encouraging this trade in
people.

      The Prime Minister has
set out the action that he intends to take in and around Syria, and
also here at home. He has been very clear about not becoming involved
in the EU quota system. Given that, and given the very real pressures
faced by the countries on the frontline—particularly Greece and
Italy—is there any assistance that the United Kingdom can give
those countries with the processing of the applications and with the
refugees?

      Yes, we can and we do. We help them with
their capacity in terms of fingerprinting and sorting people. Part of
the problem with the Schengen system is that people who come to Greece
and Italy then transit onwards, rather than doing what they ought to
do, which is to provide their details so that they can make their
asylum applications in the first country they arrive in. We are helping
with that, as it is part of the problem that Schengen is coping with at
the moment.

that this country and this Government have taken: meeting the 0.7% of
GDP for our aid budget when no other major country in the world has
done it. That has saved countless lives and this country can be proud

      Would the Prime Minister
concede that perhaps the Government have been a little slow out of the
traps in responding to this crisis, perhaps because Ministers are a bit
befuddled by an artificial debate that conflates economic migrants with
refugees, and indeed that conflates economic migrants with the European
Union debate that Conservative Members are having? Would he also care
to comment on the editorial policy of newspapers that deliberately
include provocative articles by deliberately provocative writers saying
it is absolutely fine to send gunboats to stop refugees, and change

scheme was designed to focus on need, rather than meeting a quota. Is
the Prime Minister now imposing a quota of 20,000 on that scheme? What
will he say to the 20,001st person who has a provable and legitimate
need?

      Does the Prime Minister agree
that the downside of the Opposition’s suggestion of taking
refugees from mainland Europe is that it gives a green light
to people smugglers and encourages exploitation? We have a good record
in this country, thanks to this Government, of tackling modern slavery
and human trafficking, and it would be wrong at this stage to turn our
back on the genuine progress that we have
made.

      The Prime Minister’s
statement completely fails to realise either the scale or the urgency
of the humanitarian crisis that faces us. It also fails to recognise
the huge well of generosity in our country at the moment. People in
every one of our constituencies are desperate to help. If the Prime
Minister wants a moment for his big society, this is it. Will he come
back to this House tomorrow with a statement that recognises not only
the scale of the catastrophe that faces the Syrian people, but the huge
desire in our constituencies to help them? Let us do more to help these
people and have a statement of which to be
proud.

      Most fair-minded
people in this country will not regard the Prime Minister’s
proposal as a proper response to the situation. Taking in and giving
sanctuary to 4,000 people a year over the next five years when we are
in the midst of the largest global refugee crisis since the
second world war is woefully inadequate. We should be
ashamed that we are not doing more. Furthermore, the distinction
between people in the refugee camps and those already in
Europe is quite spurious. There have been references to the little boy
who was washed up on the shores of Turkey. What if that little boy had
not drowned, and his parents had applied to this country for refuge and
sanctuary? Would we have said that our doors were closed to
them?

      On the second issue, we do not publish the

      On
the asylum system, of course we want to speed it up; we have sped it

have come from. We will continue to do that, but let me stress that
these 20,000 Syrians will not have to go through some lengthy asylum

      The number of
people standing to ask questions has, I think, shown the strength of
feeling and interest in the House. Most Members have welcomed the
Government’s decision to take more refugees directly from the
camps near Syria and the Government’s aid to the region, where
they are ahead of every other country and are making an extremely
important contribution. The Prime Minister is right, too, that the
issues in the camps are serious, with a lack of schooling for thousands
of people and a cut in rations meaning that the conditions are
desperate and we should help.

      The response
in the Chamber today has raised two significant concerns
about the Prime Minister’s response. The first is about the
scale of the response— the 20,000 people he will help
over five years—and the second is about the lack of help for
refugees who have already fled into Europe. Interior Ministers are
meeting on the 14th and the crisis is still escalating. This is not
just about the tragic scenes we have seen of Alan Kurdi and others who
have drowned or the families who are ready to walk from Hungary to
Austria to find a safe home. This is also about our chance to discuss
the number of people the Prime Minister has offered to help:
20,000 over five years could mean 4,000 a year, whereas the
Kindertransport took 10,000 children in the space of nine months. I
would urge the Prime Minister to reconsider and to see what more we can
do with councils and communities across the country that have come
forward asking to help and to do more. He has rightly changed his mind
already in response to public concern. I ask for the House to have the
opportunity to persuade him to do so again, given the urgent need to
provide
help.

      I
ask the Prime Minister to consider again helping those refugees who are
already in Europe and who need help. He says that he does not want to
encourage people to travel. I say to him that they are travelling
already. They are not waiting for a response from the British
Government. The refugees in Greece need particular help and
humanitarian aid. Many are already being helped through Hungary and
Austria, but in Greece there are thousands who are desperate
for help. We could do more. We have a chance to work with other
European countries, putting pressure on them to do more.

hours and will arise on a motion that the House has considered the
specified matter set out in the right hon. Member’s
application.

      Mr Speaker, I wish to raise a point of
order on the contempt shown towards this House by the Home Office, as
evidenced by its treatment of a case that I wrote to the Home Secretary
about last month. It relates to a constituent who came to see me and
told me that she had moved into my constituency. She gave me her old
address and her new address. I immediately wrote to the Home Secretary,
on 17 August. I did not expect a reply from her, because in five years
she has sent me only one letter, but I thought that my letter might be
passed to a junior Minister. Instead, I received an undated letter from
UK Visas and Immigration. The email date on the letter was 25 August.
It

      May I say to the Father of the House that I think
he is almost always, including today, the means of his own salvation?
There were occasions in the previous Parliament when the right hon.

with not having received a reply from a Minister, and I think that on
more than one occasion he received a reply from someone who did not
exist—the name on the letter was that of someone who did not

      Look,
these are not matters in which the Chair ordinarily becomes involved,
but I have the highest regard for the courtesy that the Home Secretary
has always shown to me, and which ordinarily she has always shown to
the House. I think that it is much easier to respect the traditions and
courtesies of the House and to err on the side of speed of
response and, if I may say so, also on the side of acknowledging a very
senior and long-serving Member who has made an approach.

he feels that he has not been. I know that the Home Secretary will do

      On a point of order, Mr
Speaker. After those words, I must be very careful what I say. Earlier
today you quite rightly amended the business for Wednesday to allow for
special recognition of Her Majesty’s becoming our
longest-serving monarch. Unfortunately, one consequence of that is that
questions to the Secretary of State for Wales moves to the following
week and questions to the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland,
which we would have considered on that day, sadly fall. As these are
dark and desperate days in Northern Ireland, and as it is very
important that the House debate these, matters and questions Ministers,
is there any mechanism whereby the timetable can be further amended so
that we can have Northern Ireland questions before the conference
recess?

      Not readily, no. However, there are various means
by which Members can secure the presence of Ministers if important
matters arise on which those Members wish to probe. The hon. Gentleman

discuss a motion and an opportunity to vote; that will be immensely

      There may well be such an opportunity for a
number of reasons, although I cannot guarantee it. First, it is
possible that, having heard the right hon. Gentleman speaking with the
authority of his office, and having heard what was said by the hon.
Member for Ealing North, the Government may choose to provide such a
debate. That is one possibility; another is a debate courtesy of the
Backbench Business Committee; and a third—depending on the
nature of the circumstances, and their urgency or otherwise—is a
debate under Standing Order No. 24. So there are opportunities. The
right hon. Gentleman is very experienced and I know he will keep an eye

that colleagues might have in these circumstances. I hope that that is

      Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. I always think
that it is marginally to my advantage to speak when I am trying to
persuade hon. Members to support my cause. Many people have argued to
the contrary —that silence could be golden in the
circumstances—but looking at the programme motion, I do not
think the Government should succeed. Only six weeks have passed since
we were here discussing the European Referendum Bill. Of course I
understand the Government’s anxiety to progress the business
while the Labour party is concerned about other matters, but the motion
on the Order Paper strikes me as hardly adequate for reasonable
discussion.

      Those of us
who were present during the Committee stage will remember, among many
other events, a last-minute starred amendment allowed relating to the
timing of the referendum; the Government facing defeat on the issue of
purdah; and the absolute confidence with which the Leader of the House
and the Minister told us that the question to be put in the referendum
was already more or less accepted by the Electoral Commission and that
we did not have to worry about that process.

      Now we come
to Report stage, and we find that we are to have two and a half hours
to debate the issue of purdah. We also find that a Government
amendment—new clause 10—was tabled so late that you, Mr
Speaker, have allowed a manuscript amendment to that new clause. I have
absolutely no idea what the Government were doing during the six weeks
of recess that they were only able to table a new clause so late as to
allow a manuscript amendment to it. That will cause considerable
controversy, and I imagine that debating it will take up the full two
and a half hours.

referendum, they have lost control of the conduct of the referendum and
they have been overturned on the referendum question, all in the space
of the last few weeks. Their attempt to rush the Bill through this
House has not served them well, and even at this last ditch, I think
they would do 
well to consider coming back with a more adequate timetable. The
Government might thereby serve the interests of the House, and probably
their own interests, rather better than they have been

      In Committee, I promised to reflect on the
concerns that were raised about the Government’s proposal to
disapply, for the purposes of the EU referendum, section 125 of the
Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000. The Government
accept completely the importance of the referendum being conducted in a
way that is both fair and seen to be fair by the partisans on both
sides of the debate. In particular, that means that the conduct of both
Ministers and civil servants must be beyond reproach. We are therefore
bringing to the House today proposals that we believe provide the
rigorous safeguards wanted by hon. Members on both sides of the
House.

to the general prohibition in section 125, subject to an affirmative

      Why is it necessary for the Government to make any
amendment to section 125? The Electoral Commission has carried out
statutory reviews of the referendums since 2004 and has not identified
any significant concerns from the Government or any other party about
the application of section 125. Why are the Government changing the

worked well and that they have used in the

      We are bringing forward limited exemptions from

advice on this—that if left completely unamended, it would pose
genuine difficulties. I will go on to speak in some detail about this

      Of course my right hon. Friend has received
legal advice, but legal advice can cut both ways. Indeed,
Speaker’s Counsel has made it clear that he does not think there
is much of a problem in respect of the issues the Minister has just
been describing. Not only have the Electoral Commission and
Speaker’s Counsel been clear on these points, but if regulations
are introduced, they will come in by way of the affirmative procedure
after the Bill has been enacted and there will be no opportunity to
amend them, because regulations, being statutory instruments, can only
be accepted or rejected in their entirety. Does my right hon. Friend
not
agree?

      In answer to my hon. Friend’s last
point, if the House is dissatisfied with any regulation that the
Government put before Parliament, it can reject the statutory
instrument. In that case, the default position under the package that I
am proposing to the House would be to revert to section 125 without the
exemptions being made by regulation. There is, therefore, the safeguard
that Parliament will have the final
say.

not be interrupting the flow of people to whom the Government are only
too anxious to make any concession that is demanded and who are
obviously quite clear about what result they want from the
referendum—indeed, they are rather more concerned about the
result than the process—but will the Minister confirm that,
whatever further concessions he is now making, it will still be
possible for Ministers to give a clear and authoritative opinion on
whether, according to the constitutional Government of the country, it
is in the best interests of the United Kingdom in respect of its
political future in the world and its economic prospects to be in or

      The answer to my right hon. and learned
Friend’s question is that the Government will, of course,
express their view very clearly at the conclusion of the negotiations
and make their recommendation to the country, giving their reasons for
so doing. One aspect of the debate about which we have concerns is how
the Government, who will have called the referendum and made a
recommendation to the British people, should be able to express their
view and answer questions in the final four weeks, as he described. The
debate about so-called purdah and section 125 relates specifically to
the final 28 days of the

      Many
hon. Members have said that the purdah rules that apply during
elections have worked well and I agree. Of course, those rules are
based entirely on guidance and convention. They allow for common sense
and involve no legal risk. Section 125 of the 2000 Act is very
different, since it is a statutory restriction. Given that the EU
referendum debate will, I think we would all accept, involve people on
both sides of the argument with deep personal pockets and passionate
views on the subject, the risk of legal challenges during the campaign
is real. The Government are seeking, through the amendments, to manage

      With respect, I think
that this is legalistic claptrap. I do not remember the Prime Minister
being particularly constrained in arguing his case during the general
election. What is important is that the process is considered to be
fair. Why can we not just cut to the chase and accept amendment 4,
which was tabled by the Opposition, under which we would have full
purdah and do what we do in general elections, so that everybody thinks
it is
fair?

      As I have just said to the House, what the
Government can and cannot do in general elections is governed by
guidance and convention, and not by statute, which brings the risk that
a dispute could end up before the courts. The situation as regards the
EU referendum is different, because there is law on the statute book,
dating from 2000, so discretion and common sense cannot be applied in
the way that is possible during elections, when we rely on
guidance.

      On
amendment 53, we believe that section 125, as drafted in the 2000 Act,

the breadth of the wording that describes and defines the material that

      Unlike the
recent cases of the Scottish or alternative vote referendums, the
subject matter of the EU referendum cannot simply be avoided in
Government communications during the last 28 days. The subject of EU
membership is broad. A Government statement in Brussels on an EU issue
under negotiation could be said to be dealing with an issue raised by
the question of our membership, and therefore be caught by the
restrictions in section 125. Let me provide an

      There are
ongoing negotiations between the EU and the United States on the
Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership. It is perfectly
conceivable that, at some stage during the last month of our referendum
campaign, those negotiations could reach a stage at which there would
be a discussion between the institutions of the EU and member states of
the EU. The British Government would have a view on the right outcome
and might want to circulate papers to lobby, using the sort of
materials that would be captured by the section 125 definition of
publication. If the section remains unamended, my concern is that there
is a risk that that will be challenged in court, because it could be
said to be raised by the referendum campaign. It is certainly
conceivable that one or other or both of the campaign organisations
could pray in aid that particular issue as indicating why we should or
should not remain a member of the EU. Once that happened, it would
certainly be classed as raised by the referendum
campaign.

      I am grateful to the
Minister for giving way. He is, as usual, helpful in explaining his
case. In reality, however, if that situation arose the discussions
would not happen in the 28 days when this country was making up its
mind whether it wanted to be part of the European Union. That just
would not happen. The EU is very good at putting things off and the
idea that that example is a reason for changing the law is
fanciful.

      My hon. Friend does not understand the extent
to which we simply do not know. One member state can control the timing
of items on the agenda. The timing depends on which particular
illustration one is looking at, but the country holding the rotating
presidency of the European Union will decide which items of business
appear on the agenda of Council and COREPER meetings. The Commission
will decide when to publish new proposals for, or amendments to,
legislation. The European Parliament is a law unto itself. Its sessions
will continue during our referendum campaign and the British Government
are likely to want to circulate published material, under the terms of
the 2000 Act, to try to influence decisions of MEPs in a way that
favours our national interest.

Minister’s case is that some nefarious other Government will
seize the opportunity of the 28-day period to rush something through
the European Union. If so, that will be the fastest bout of
decision-making in the EU’s

      I am saying that the European Union is a
constant process of negotiation on a whole range of issues involving
Ministers and officials from many different Departments. In the course
of that work to champion our national interests, Ministers and their
officials have to produce materials that I believe could be
classed, under section 125, as published material and material the
content of which would deal with an issue raised by the referendum
question. As well as covering a wide range of content, the 2000 Act
gives a very broad definition of the term “publish”. It

      May I give the Minister an example of what I fear?
What I envisage is if, two weeks before the date of the referendum, the
leave campaign is 10 points ahead in the poll—I hope it will be
further ahead, but for argument’s sake let us just say it will
be 10 points ahead—I am not sure that the Minister’s
amendment will deal with the prospect of the Government, the European
Commission and the German Chancellor all in a mad panic, like the
clumsy intervention in the Scottish vow, standing up and saying,
“We hear what you are saying and if you vote to stay in we
promise to address some of these issues.” Will the Minister give
a commitment now that the Government will not engage in that kind of
activity?

for example to set out the UK position on the limits of powers

reference to have on the record, and we make them public and publish
them. We circulate papers to other Governments and to the institutions
to advocate particular policy outcomes. We did that with some success

      If a decision to attempt to reach a consensus
at Council happens to be timed to fall within those 28 days—I do
not think we can assume that all EU business is going to stop for the
last 28 days of our 
campaign—then of course, in those circumstances, the Government
would want to make representations, including circulating the type of
paper I have described. European Court of Justice judgments are handed
down and advocates-general opinions are presented in a timetable that
is not within our gift or influence. Again, the Government not only
often wish to comment on such matters but to guide British business and
other interest groups on what those judgments or recommendations
actually mean. For example, had the recent case on European Central
Bank clearances gone against us, there would have been an extremely
urgent need to write to notify City institutions on the implications of
that judgment for them, to avoid a risk of instability in the
markets.

      My right hon. Friend is so desperate to give way
to everything put to him, I do not think I am his friend at all. In my
opinion, he has already given away far too much. I quite understand
why: the opportunism of the Opposition parties, which do not agree with
the hard-line Eurosceptics in my party but which are determined to vote
with our rebels to force this preposterous situation on us. Will he
assure me that if, two weeks before the campaign ends, a decision is
suddenly taken to finish health and safety or food safety regulations
in some key area, because a judgment of the European Court has meant
that hundreds will die or the horticulture industry will be wiped out,
a Minister will be allowed, in these complex trade matters, on TTIP and
so on, to consult officials and give some authoritative, clear
description of what the decision or proposal actually means? I do not
think that most of our right-wing newspapers would report what he would
say based on factual advice, but could we leave open the possibility
that he can at least consult experts on the negotiations before giving
statements on behalf of the Government?

      I want to make a suggestion and throw the Minister
a lifeline he may wish to grasp. I think we all agree that both sides
want to be sure that the referendum is fair, and I hope both sides
agree that the Electoral Commission is independent, impartial and
professional in organising referendums. New clause 10 is so
drafted that the only duty on a Minister introducing regulations to
make exemptions from purdah is that the commission is consulted. I

      We wanted, if possible, to avoid language that
relied on statements about the intention of a particular
publication—to use the language in section 125—because
once we get into questions about the intention of the publisher, we are
almost inviting a legal challenge and wrangle over what was intended or
not intended. I considered whether we ought to adopt the approach that
I think lies behind my hon. Friend’s question and list
exhaustively the types of publication that might be covered. The
difficulty is that it is in the nature of EU business that it sometimes
proceeds at a stately pace but sometimes rapidly and at
short notice, and I felt that the Government needed the ability to
respond and that a list purporting to be exhaustive would make it more
difficult to manage the legal risks. To sum up, we thought
that in managing the legal risks the most effective way to proceed was
to balance them with a reinforced safeguard against the misuse of the
limited
exemption.

that since the late ’90s, when the legislation was first framed
by the Labour Government, the Conservative party, first in opposition
and then in government, has never once said that there was any problem
with the legislation in all the referendums we have had? We accepted it

      The legislation is now 15 years old, and the
more we have gone into its detail, the more I have come to the view
that many of its provisions, including some we are not planning to
amend, would benefit from a review simply to bring it up to date. For
example, it was written in an age before the digital communications and
social media that are now normal. We have considered this matter in
detail and taken serious legal advice, and we believe that there are

      On new clause
10, on Second Reading, the Foreign Secretary and I argued that given
that the referendum was being held on the basis of a clear Government
commitment and that voters would be asked in effect whether they agreed
or disagreed with a Government recommendation, following a
Government-led renegotiation, it was reasonable for Ministers to be
able, with restraint, to use ordinary Government communications
channels and civil service support, including during the final 28 days
of the campaign. However, it was clear from the
debates at earlier stages and from my conversations with hon. Members
on both sides of the House that there was widespread concern about the
scope of any general exemption for Government
communications.

      Let me
explain the kind of things I have in mind. They include, for example,
modernising the press notice exemption, which is already in section
125, to take account of digital media, by making it clear that it is
permissible to link to a press notice from a website or a social media
site; allowing the publication of a document on government.uk; or
clarifying that material passed on to the print or broadcasting media

      I
return to the point raised by my right hon. and learned Friend the
Member for Rushcliffe (Mr Clarke). This power by regulation could be
used to clarify a possible de minimis common-sense use of official
resources; it might be permissible for Ministers or others caught by
section 125 as it currently stands to apply it. Depending on the
phrasing of a regulation—if Parliament accepts it—it
might cover fact checking by officials so that a Minister could respond
in a ministerial capacity to a particular statement that had been made
about the Government’s position. It would be for Parliament to
say whether it was permitted or not; and on my reading of section 125,
it is not currently
permitted.

four weeks during which they cannot check the factual accuracy of
anything the Minister says on a controversial European subject. The
Government will be unable to use the resources of the civil service to
put out statements, including factual statements, on what propositions
are correct, and they will be unable to use any Government resources to
explain the merits or otherwise of what will be the Government’s
position on a particular issue. We have not covered this problem; we
have already gone—farcically—too far in neutralising the
ability of the Government to give an authoritative opinion and
explanation of the facts and the issues in the course of the

      Let
me be straight about this. Both the Foreign Secretary and I were rather
taken aback when we received advice saying that there was a risk that
elected representatives or anybody else in the public sector might be
caught by the provision. A literal reading of that part of
section 125 suggests that that might be the case. It is also
true that this does not seem to have been a significant issue in
previous referendums. It has not been tested in the courts and there is
room for legal argument. It would be possible under the automating
power to put that beyond any doubt.

      To
ensure that the electorate are properly informed so that they can take
a decision on our future relationship with Europe on that basis rather
than on an emotional basis, we need a proper cost-benefit analysis of
the whole issue. It should not be applied just to immigration, which is
the issue of today, but to how much the EU costs, how much we get out
of it, how the regulations impact on businesses and jobs and so forth,
so that the electorate can make an informed
choice.

      I am somewhat astonished that the Government are
raising the question of hon. Members somehow being caught by purdah
provisions. It is an established legal principle that titles of
sections are not used to determine construction in legal
interpretation. The word “person”—here I take the
advice of Speaker’s Counsel—is likely to mean “a
legal person” and to be of a similar nature to “a
body”. The Minister’s suggestion that this might
constitute “individuals” betrays, I think, the poor legal
advice he has been given.

      It would be premature to bring forward draft
regulations before the Bill has completed its progress through this
House and before it has even started in the House of Lords. The
provisions in amendment 53 include a duty on the Government, following
the Select Committee’s advice, to consult the Electoral
Commission about anything we might want to bring forward under this
measure. Then, of course, those have to be laid before Parliament in
the usual way, be debated and be approved or not approved in the same

could not join in a referendum. We all know that MPs join in referendum

they do so as politicians. They are, quite rightly, not allowed any MP

      During general election campaigns, we are not
Members of Parliament. Parliament has been dissolved, and we act as
individuals, putting ourselves forward as candidates. In the case of
local or European parliamentary elections, Independent Parliamentary
Standards Authority rules apply to how our expenses may be spent.

      Let me now
address amendment (a), tabled by the Chairman of the Select Committee.
It suggests that there should be a period of four months between
Parliament’s agreeing to any statutory instrument and the date
of the referendum. I can see the case for that. It would
provide an assurance that the Government would not try to rush through
secondary legislation, and it would ensure that Parliament had ample
time to consider the matter for it to be on the statute book before the
referendum campaign, in its most ardent stages, got under way. However,
I felt that the difficulty was that it would introduce a rigidity into
the timing that was unwelcome—
      <I>
       [Interruption.]

      Let me
finish. We do not know exactly what might happen during the period that
we are considering. If something were to come up and there was a
consensus in Parliament that a change, a narrow exemption, was needed,
we would be unable to introduce it at a later stage if we accepted the
minimum period of four months that my hon. Friend has
proposed.

      Having
thought long and hard about the matter and discussed it with
colleagues, I have concluded that, largely in the interests of trying
to secure as great a consensus as possible, we will accept amendment
(a). As I have said, I think that a firm time limit of that type has
drawbacks, but, in the interests of bridge-building—and paying
due respect to the recommendation of a cross-party Select
Committee—I am prepared to accept the amendment on the
Government’s
behalf.

      Since
the Bill’s publication, there has been a great deal of debate
about the purdah provisions, and specifically about the proposal in
paragraph 26 of schedule 1 to strike out the purdah regime set out in

been a great deal of comment about the Government’s motivations.
The accusation has been made that they want to load the dice, and to
set up a regime for the

the feel of a Bill that was drawn up quickly on the back of the
election result, with some advice adopted about what purdah might or
might not mean, but without that advice being explored and tested as
intensely as it might have been in other circumstances. It looks as
though the self-imposed imperative of moving immediately after the
Queen’s Speech may have taken over from the task of bottoming

      I am not sure
whether, when Ministers drew up the Bill, they expected the purdah
provision to generate this amount of heat. I rather suspect
that they did not, but having included the provision in the Bill, they
have had to justify it. As we have heard from the Minister this
evening, their justification has been twofold. The first justification
is that section 125 of the 2000 Act is so widely drawn that it would
paralyse much of the Government’s work on the EU referendum, in
a way that would not be the case with a referendum on another subject.

      We listened
carefully to the arguments advanced on Second Reading and in Committee.
Our proposals are set out in new clauses 5 and 6, and in amendment 4.
Taken collectively, those proposals would leave the purdah regime in
place, but there would also be a mechanism for seeking exceptions to it
through regulations that would have to be approved by Parliament. That
would have several effects. It would put Parliament in the driving seat
when it came to deciding whether the Government had a case for
exceptions to purdah and testing some of the arguments that the
Minister has just set out; it would act as a safeguard against the
suggestion that the referendum was being run in an unfair way, if
Parliament were tasked with approving the regulations; and, as I have
said, it would provide a mechanism for testing the proposition that
“business as usual” Government announcements—for
example, responses to urgent situations or important decisions made at
the European Council— would inadvertently be caught by the
purdah regime. We believe that this approach—reinstating purdah,
but allowing a mechanism via regulations for exceptions to it—is
a sensible way to
proceed.

      The
Government’s response to the issues raised is set out in new
clause 10 and amendment 53, and I would like to spend a few minutes on
those. Government new clause 10 accepts our argument about
having an 
exceptions-to-purdah mechanism through regulations
approved by Parliament. Indeed, as the Minister set out, there is a
great deal of overlap between Government new clause 10 and our new
clause 6, but Government new clause 10 has the added dimension of the
requirement to consult the Electoral Commission, something asked for by
the Public Administration Committee in the correspondence from July. We
believe this is a sensible addition and therefore have no objection to
new clause 10; nor do we object to the amendment, which the
Government have accepted, tabled by the hon. Member for Harwich and
North Essex (Mr Jenkin) about the timescale for
this.

      However,
as with much of this debate, amendments and new clauses need to be seen
in conjunction with other amendments, in this case
Government amendment 53, which makes alterations to the definition of
purdah. We do not believe the Government have made a convincing case
for those alterations. It is unclear whether the amendment is intended
to deal with the business-as-usual issues that the Government have
spoken of as being a particular problem, or whether it goes much
further in the alteration of the purdah regime. Perhaps more
importantly, given the wide redrawing of the purdah rules in
this amendment, if it is passed it is not clear whether there will be
any need at all for the kind of exceptions regime set out in new
clauses 10 and 6. We feel that would give the Government too
much scope to act without further parliamentary debate and approval,
and we will therefore not support Government amendment 53. To complete
the picture of our attitude on these amendments, I should say that we
intend to press our amendment 4 to a vote. We will support Government
new clause 10, we will oppose amendment 53, and we will support our
amendment
4.

      Our concern is that, instead of reinstating

both have an exceptions regime and change the definition of purdah in
such a way that there might not even be a need for an exceptions

      In
the end, the various amendments and new clauses tabled set out three
possible ways to deal with this issue. The first is simply to reinstate
the purdah regime with no exceptions or modifications—the route
perhaps favoured by some in this House. The second way is to reinstate
the purdah regime but have a mechanism for exceptions that are subject
to the approval of the House through regulations. That is the approach
we have set out, and that the Government have, we acknowledge, moved a
considerable way towards with the tabling of new clause 10.
The third option, which is the one the Government seem to want to
pursue, is both to water down the definition of purdah and have an
exceptions regime; that is the combined effect of new clause
10 and amendment 53. We believe that the second
approach—to have purdah, with exceptions where there is the
approval of this House—is the right
one.

      That would be the case if we did not have new

new clause 10 allows the Government to come forward with regulations

have probably got themselves into a fight that they did not entirely
intend to get into. Some of the suggestions as to what is caught by
section 125 make it look too widely drawn. The approach that we have

bring forward regulations to deal with the problems that the Minister

      First, I thank my right hon. Friend the Minister
for generously accepting amendment (a) to new clause 10. That will
provide a significant safeguard and reassurance, and it will provide
stability in the referendum campaign. It means that regulations
changing the rules will not be made halfway through the campaign,
perhaps to suit the convenience of Ministers at a time when the
temptation to avail themselves of that convenience might be
considerable, given the big issues at stake in the referendum. I am

open barn door for whatever changes to purdah the Government want to

suspicious about what kind of regulations they might bring forward. I
appreciate that there is a safeguard, in that regulations will have to

      And indeed in our own country—it was the
conduct of the Welsh referendum in 1997 that led the Committee on
Standards in Public Life to bring forward its proposals for purdah,
which the then Labour 
Government accepted and which the Labour party consistently supports
today. Those arrangements were good enough for the north-east
referendum, the alternative vote referendum and the most recent Welsh
devolution referendum. Indeed, in the view of some Members, they were
probably not strong enough in respect of the Scottish referendum last
year.

      As my right
hon. Friend the Member for Wokingham (John Redwood) said, the purdah
proposals were designed for a referendum on the euro, so the idea that
the European Union was not considered when the arrangements were

introduced the 2000 Act in order that there could be a fair referendum
on the euro, which was his ambition. If these arrangements were good
enough for Tony Blair, why are they not good enough for our own

we should follow in the last 28 days of campaigning. Indeed, the
Foreign Secretary could bring forward a White Paper before the start of
the 28-day period, just as the Scottish Executive brought forward a
comprehensive White Paper about their proposals for Scottish
independence, although it was lacking in detail and a little bit
partisan—we had some comments to make about that. There is
nothing to stop the Government bringing forward as much information as
they want before the purdah period. Incidentally, the Electoral
Commission thinks that 28 days is far too short for a purdah period and
we are not debating that today. If the Government, with all the
advantages that Governments have, cannot win the referendum just

      I have never known a referendum of any
major consequence in which the losing side has not followed up its
defeat by saying it has been cheated 
and that the electorate has just been misled. That has been said ever
since the 1975 referendum, and the Scottish nationalists have said the
same thing ever since the Scottish referendum. The Government have no
intention of putting out publicity, as they have said. The basic
proposition should be that the Government of the day, when putting out
a statement of their policy or an explanation of their position on a
particular proposal—such as whether or not we as members of the
European Union should be party to a TTIP with the United
States—should be entitled to use the civil service and their
press office as a source of advice and checking the factual accuracy of
what Ministers are saying on behalf of the Government. The alternative
is preposterous: under my hon. Friend’s proposition, for three

      That is absolute nonsense. Even in a general
election, Ministers can get advice from their Departments. Ministers
also take advice during local government elections. If something
happens that is unconnected with the referendum, Ministers will be able
to take advice. I have heard it said that Ministers want to use their
private offices to organise their speaking tours and to use their
special advisers, who are paid for by the taxpayer, to campaign in the
referendum. That is not an acceptable use of public money. What is the
point of placing spending limits on the yes and no campaigns if the
Government are going to avail themselves of all those advantages? My
right hon. and learned Friend could persuade the Government to produce
a White Paper to set out their case well in advance of the purdah
period. That is an unimpeded advantage of which the Government can
avail themselves. All we are saying is that there should be something
of a level playing field in the last 28

      Most of my Committee would certainly agree that
this is making the best of a bad job. We will, however, make some
progress today if we succeed in restoring section 125 under amendment
4, which the Opposition have pledged to put to a vote should
amendment 53 be defeated. I therefore advise my colleagues,
very reluctantly, to vote against amendment 53, because while I think
the Government have conceded the principle that there should be purdah,
they have not accepted the fact of how it will apply. If they want to
amend the Bill again in the other place, it would be worth while having
that discussion, rather than accepting amendment
53.

      I will certainly undertake to put that in front of
my Committee. It depends on the Government: if they table amendments 35
minutes before the deadline and a recess period and are then determined
to discuss them on the first day back, it makes it very difficult to
scrutinise matters, as the Electoral Commission has attested. I invite
my right hon. Friend the Minister for Europe to make sure that any
regulations he introduces under new clause 10 are published in draft so
that we can properly give them pre-legislative scrutiny,
take proper advice on them and make objective
recommendations to the House without being rushed or bounced into
them.

      One of the
advantages of amendment (a), which my right hon. Friend has kindly
accepted, is that the temptation to bounce the country into a
referendum has been significantly reduced. If we are to have a sensible
referendum debate, there has to be a proper period for discussion of
the outcome of the Government’s negotiations and the merits or
otherwise of remaining in or leaving the European Union. I am sure that
was the Government’s ambition when they originally proposed the
idea of a referendum. I look forward to hearing what the Minister has
to say in winding
up.

      The Chair of

good enough for the House now. I am afraid that the alliance of

      The hon.
Gentleman made another point with which I disagreed, and I want to put
this on record before I come to the points on which I agreed with him.
He wandered into a period outside the purdah and asked whether at that
point the Government had the right to publish a White Paper giving
their point of view, backed as a democratically elected Government by
the civil service. Of course they have the right to do that, but the
House should be concerned about whether the restrictions should apply
during the 28-day purdah period, or perhaps for a week longer were the
Electoral Commission to have its way. I think that they
should, and I shall illustrate that view with a cautionary and moral
tale from the Scottish referendum.

      In
other words, acting in their capacity as Ministers, they were not

out to those on the Government Front Bench today that nobody

something similar for this referendum, instead of doing whatever they

      Yes, indeed it was, but we are discussing the
28-day purdah period at the moment. It has been suggested to me by a
knowledgeable European that President Barroso, as he then was,
harboured ambitions to be the Secretary-General of NATO and was hoping
for support from Ministers—perhaps not those in the Chamber
tonight, but those who are none the less not too far from us. Who knows
why President Barroso made those interventions, but they were not made
during the 28-day purdah period.

      The
cautionary aspect of this tale is that that purdah period, enacted in

      One
of the arguments in favour of purdah is that the arguments should be
laid out and set before the campaign period, and that during the
campaign the politicians can debate them and the people can participate
in the debate—as they did in huge numbers in Scotland—and

make up their minds. It is not meant to be a period

I should like to put on record that I share his view that the vow made

      The
second example that I shall give the House is, in my view, beyond
argument. The purdah period is meant to cover not only Government
Ministers but civil servants. Their involvement is arguably defensible
throughout the run-up to a referendum. I disagree with the Select
Committee on this point; I believe that civil servants should be able
to act on behalf of the elected Government of the day. However, during
the purdah period, they are not meant to take a position on the matter
that has been put in front of the people. I want to make a point about
the referendum unit in Her Majesty’s Treasury, which was
described by the permanent secretary to the Treasury earlier this year
as a “Unionist institution”. The clue is in the name: Her
Majesty’s Treasury. This ignores the fact that the monarchy in
its present state was formed a century before the treaty of Union,
which was under debate. The referendum unit in the Treasury continued
its activities throughout the referendum campaign.

      I have an
email here showing the briefing from Treasury sources that was going on
a week before the referendum. The email was sent to the BBC by a civil

Treasury—that Unionist institution—and it was designed to
influence the conduct of the referendum, one week before the vote. That
seems to be a glaring example of what would have been a breach of the
purdah regulations, had they been placed in statute rather than simply
in the terms of the Edinburgh agreement.

      That is why I
turn to our amendment 11. The Minister told us earlier that he did not
want to be in a position where legal challenges were flying here, there
and 
everywhere, as that would be an impossible position for the Government
to be in. The way to avoid that is not by dismissing the regulations,
but by having a system for enforcing the regulations—one that
does not rely on injunctions, interdicts or legal cases, but one within
the regulations that is properly respected. The hon. Member for North
Down (Lady Hermon) made the point in an earlier intervention about the
Electoral Commission. The way to avoid a recurrence of what happened in
the Scottish referendum and to dispel the notion that the Government
over these past four months have been trying to pull a fast one on
purdah, which is the overwhelming view across this Chamber at this
moment, is by having an enforcement mechanism within the regulations on
purdah. That could be done via the Electoral Commission, as the hon.
Lady suggested, or via a committee of Privy Counsellors—ever
since I became one I have become much friendlier to the idea of a
committee of Privy Counsellors. There needs to be some respected body
to which possible breaches of purdah can be reported, and these can be
investigated and then enforced.

      I think the right hon. Gentleman and I are in
agreement about the role of civil servants—obeying the
Government of the day but not carrying out instructions that would put
their Ministers in breach of purdah. There should be something in the
civil service code that makes it clear that the yes and no campaigns of
a referendum are the equivalent of political parties in an election,
but the code contains nothing about referendums. I have great sympathy
with the point he is making about the enforcement of purdah, because
the north-east referendum had exactly the same problem as he is
describing; John Prescott announced new proposals in the last few days
before the referendum and we could not get anybody in government
interested—they said it was a matter for
Ministers.

      That question was some time in the gestation, and
I had moved on from what I described as the “arguable”
case of the vow. The vow was not a single appearance on “The
Andrew Marr Show”, and I used the quote from that show just to
demonstrate to the House that the vow was presented as a new
initiative, something different, a last-minute offer. The argument
about whether the vow breached purdah has been made well by the hon.
Member for Shipley (Philip Davies) and the analogy in a European
referendum would be a 
re-presentation. Presumably, the idea in the European referendum is
meant to be that the Prime Minister renegotiates this country’s
relationships with the EU and then presents that to the people for
consideration of whether they want to be in or out on that basis. The
equivalent idea here, therefore, would be that he finishes that
renegotiation but things are going badly in the campaign and so there
is a further renegotiation and re-presentation. I certainly do not
believe that is within the spirit of a purdah regulation, although
people might argue that it meets the letter of it.

      I accept that
that point is debatable—I am pretty clear which side I am
on—but there is no debate whatsoever about the behaviour of
officials in Her Majesty’s Treasury in the referendum unit who
were actively briefing and intervening during the campaign. The reason
that was allowed to happen is that, as the Chair of the Select
Committee said, the civil service code does not specify referendums in
the way that it does elections and there was no statutory basis for the
enforcement of purdah in the UK Government as there was for

but I was hoping that the hon. Gentleman’s warm reception to my
point might convince those in all parts of the House that there was
something sensible in not just talking about purdah but actually having
an organised enforcement mechanism and putting in place my

        Sir
William Cash:
       </Member>
      </B>
      I would just like to take up the point that
the right hon. Gentleman ended on. For all the reasons that I gave in
Committee, when I put the case for going back to section 125 in its
complete integrity, in order to have fairness it is essential that we
have something by which people abide. A lot of this debate tends, from
time to time, to move between what the Conservative party says or what
Labour, the Liberal Democrats or the Scottish National party say.
First, it 
was decided that we were going to have a European Union referendum Bill,
and now the Electoral Commission has changed the nature of the
question, with the consent of the Government. The question now is,
“Do you, the voters of this country, want to remain in or do you
want to leave?” This has cut completely across all political
parties. Therefore, although this debate is taking place in this
Chamber, the nature of this debate involving the Conservatives, Labour
and the SNP must not be allowed to distort the fact that this is a vote
about the real future of the individual people of this country. It is
about the voters deciding for the first time since 1975 whether they
are going to stay in what I regard now as a dysfunctional European
Union—the immigration issue has recently made that even more
obvious—or whether we are going to continue to argue that we
should leave, because we can make that case. That is to come and the
bottom line is that this Bill is not about “Conservative versus
Labour”; it should be about the positions adopted across the
Floor of the House. I know for a fact that many Labour Back Benchers
agree with those who share my view on the Conservative Back
Benches—and there are some on the Front Benches, too. It may
well turn out that we will need to address the question later of
whether or not Ministers should be allowed to participate on either
side of the debate in the national interest.

      I was
particularly taken by and interested in the recent article the Minister
wrote on “ConservativeHome”, in which he rather gave the
game away. He and I have been discussing this since 1990, when he was
special adviser to no less than the Foreign Secretary and other people
in No. 10 were desk officers for the Government position at that time
under John Major. Let me read what he said right at the end of his
article, because I want to concentrate on the reasons for purdah. We
have heard so many arguments in relation to the process. I
have made my position quite clear, which is that amendment 78 is more
comprehensive than amendment 4. Let me bypass that argument
for the moment in the interests of trying to achieve the best result,
but without prejudice to coming back to the matter at a later
date.

      Actually,
that is not what this debate on the referendum will be about. Elements
of the argument will demonstrate that there are certain advantages in
having a degree of alliance and co-operation in Europe, which I am in
favour of, but not on the basis of the status quo of the treaties, or
of the tweaking of negotiations that do not make any substantial
difference to the basis on which those treaties are conducted. That is
why I have firmly concluded that we must leave the European Union. I
have just come back from Luxembourg—
      <I>
       [Interruption.]
      </I>
      The
Foreign Secretary can ask me any question from the Dispatch Box. I have
just come back from Luxembourg where the national chairmen of a whole
raft of EU committees were debating questions relating to migration. I
can only say that the trend of the arguments was not at all in line
with many of the things that we in this House would have expected had
those arguments been put forward by our own Ministers.

      Basically, I
am cynical, to say the least, about the outcome of this debate. The
trouble is that we are being invited to cut across the fact, as my hon.
Friend the Member for Harwich and North Essex (Mr Jenkin) has said,
that there have been four referendums without any legal problems.
Furthermore, the Electoral Commission has backed amendment 78—it
did not mention amendment 4 because it knows that my
amendment deals with the devolved territories as well—and we
have Speaker’s Counsel on our side. We are told by the Minister
that, as far as he is concerned, there are a number of legal opinions,
including from two leading counsels, that have indicated that there
could be legal problems. Well, that is not what the Speaker’s
Counsel says. His advice relating to the Political and Constitutional
Reform Committee is on the website for anyone to see. He has reinforced
his view in the light of the remarks made by the Europe Minister on
“ConservativeHome”. I expressly sent the Speaker’s
Counsel a copy of that article and asked him whether he would revise
his legal view. He is very distinguished and was the legal adviser to
the European Scrutiny Committee for many years. He has also been
involved in the legal service of the European Commission. He knows what
he is talking about, and I take these other legal opinions that we are
being offered with a pinch of salt.

      Finally, I
say to the Foreign Secretary, who is chuntering quite a lot—I
say that with great respect because I rather like him—that if
those opinions are so important, let us see them. Let us see the basis
on which the advice was given, and we will hear the same old arguments
that we heard about the Iraq opinion. At the end of the day, however,
we did get the Iraq opinion. This issue may not be quite so momentous,
but none the less to fall back on the old canard that we should not
publish opinions is not actually an answer to the questions that we are
asking. We want to know the basis on which the advice was
given.

      I
just do not believe that the Government’s arguments add up. A
lack of trust has been generated, which goes deep into the
past—right the way back to the White Paper of 1971 when we were
promised that we would have a veto, which has now been overridden. We
have not been given a referendum since 1975, and it is essential that
we have a fair referendum that people can trust. I fear that the
outcome of the vote this evening will be that new clause 10 goes
through, perhaps with an amendment that might make a marginal
difference. A vote against amendment 53 will simply allow a vote on
amendment 4, which takes us back to a kind of purdah, but not the
complete purdah that I and I think the British people want under
amendment 78. We are the representatives of the people, which is why I
wish to speak so candidly on this matter.

      At
the end of this debate, we will be left with a concession on section
125, but we will not have real purdah. I have already spelled out the
reasons why real purdah is necessary. The right hon. Member for Gordon
(Alex Salmond) also indicated that the purdah in the Scottish
referendum had been vitiated by the activities of the Government. That
makes the point in its entirety. He has called for an enforcement
arrangement, but we 
do not know what the Labour party will do about that. Will it go through
the Lobby with the right hon. Gentleman? I do not know. Perhaps he does
not know either.

      I have argued
consistently and as hard as I can for real purdah because I want the
people of this country to have a fair referendum. I want them to know
that when they have made their decision, it has not been unfairly or
unduly influenced by statements made through the civil service or its
agencies, or through the European Union or by the provision of its
money, which we will come on to later. As I have set out in amendment
78, I want complete purdah. I may find that, because of circumstances,
I have to vote for amendment 4, but I want purdah with no ifs and no
buts. Ultimately, when the regulations come out after the Bill is
enacted, we will come to regret the arrangements that come from new
clause 10, amended slightly, and amendment 4. We will face a kind of
qualified purdah, which will not satisfy the test of fairness that I
really believe this country
deserves.

signed his amendment (a), and I am pleased that the Government have

said, it would have been much better to have had none of this debate

      It is
important that somebody from the Labour Back Benches says a few words

seems to be supported by all sides even though it does not go as far as
I would like. That is very important, because, whichever way this
referendum goes, if there is a sense that it is not fair, it will
devalue the whole result. I am of a certain age and I remember well the
1975 referendum, in which I participated strongly, as I have mentioned
before. I was the chair of the “Vote no” committee in
Luton and the agent for the “Vote no” position in
Bedfordshire at the time, so I know what happened very well. It was
unfair, and the resources piled into the yes side compared with the
puny resources on the no side were unbelievable. That was a travesty of
democracy. When we are voting on fundamental constitutional positions,
it is important that referendums are regarded as fair by all
sides.

      The right
hon. and learned Member for Rushcliffe (Mr Clarke), who is no longer in

ago, referendums on the European constitution took place abroad. The
political establishments in France and Holland put massive resources
into ensuring that there was a yes vote, but on both occasions there
was a no vote. I do not think that they thought that the result was
unfair, even though the big resources were on the losing side. They had
to come up with another way of dealing with the matter and, of course,
they introduced very similar constitutional changes into the European
Union.

section 125 been left in its entirety. I take a more optimistic view
than some Members. The benefit of this debate is that it has exposed
the Government trying to do something underhand. That debate has been
had and now, during the referendum, they will have not only to follow
the rules but to be seen to be following the rules of purdah. This

nature of the tentacles of the EU’s involvement in vast tracts of
just about every aspect of UK Government, although he is probably
over-concerned about this.

      My right hon.
Friend the Member for North Shropshire (Mr Paterson) put it very well
when he said that legitimacy is the most important thing, in that
whatever the outcome of the referendum, the losers, no matter which
side they are on, must be able to say to themselves and to the world at
large, “We did our best; we lost—but it was fair.”
That is the position we need to be in with this European referendum,
because it may not happen again for the next 40 years. I was interested
to hear my hon. Friend the Member for Harwich and North Essex
(Mr Jenkin) talk about the problems of the 1975 referendum.
I was obviously too young to take part in that, but it was, by all
accounts, something of a shambles. For the Welsh referendum in 1997,
the Neill Committee came up with the precursor ideas to what became the
PPERA that we know today.

      In all
legislation, simplicity is best. While PPERA is far from simple, the
purdah rules in section 125 are rules that we know. They are tried and
tested, and they have served us in quite a number of referendums. We do
not live just by legislation in this country, but by convention, a
degree of case law, decent behaviour and knowing what is right. We have
an enlarged Electoral Commission. Some might say that it is a somewhat
bloated bureaucracy, but it has earned a high degree of respect. We
have the ministerial and civil service codes. Also, the media have
changed. It was said earlier that “The Andrew Marr Show”
breaks various stories. We now accept that all these are just the new
ways of doing things. Purdah has not been broken; we know how things
are and know that normal business continues throughout elections and
referendums. We know fairness when we see it, hear it and feel
it.

      As was
described earlier, the PPERA legislation was put together in
anticipation of a euro referendum, when the same concerns that have
been aired by the Minister would have been known by the then Labour
Government. Legislation does not always do all that it should, but
PPERA served us well through the alternative vote referendum. Had there
not been local elections in 2011, many people would not even have known
that that referendum was on. No aspect of that was important to the
day-to-day basis of normal government, unlike the Scotland referendum.
PPERA has served for new forms of election as well, including the
police and crime commissioner elections. We have all appreciated that
government continues. The EU will continue to go through its
machinations whether there is a UK referendum or not.

Members may not always be in government; I doubt it, much as I hope

muddies the waters of that legislation. I would prefer amendment 4 or,
even better, amendment 78 as a far more elegant means of having a free

      It might be helpful to return to the origin of this
problem: some people, including many Conservative Members, are
concerned about tipping the scales using 
taxpayers’ funds. If this place is for
anything, it is about Members choosing to restrain power through the
law, and that is what we are seeking to do tonight. Ministers might be
tempted to take steps at the last moment to help influence the result,
so we want to ensure that they are appropriately restrained in the
usual way through normal purdah rules, or as close to them as we can
get.

      The
matter may seem very technical, but the crucial point is that the
European Union is positively anti-democratic. That can be seen in the
Lisbon treaty, and some Opposition Members have complained about it in
relation to Greece. One can see why the European Union is like that,
because it was forged in one of the western world’s greatest
failures of democracy, but this is not the moment to digress on such

problem is not this Government. The problem is that an establishment

travel in the Lisbon treaty, and that is what politicians on the other

their business. I have great faith that if the Public Administration

the European Union, which has been the cause célèbre,
requirement and demand of many for generations. I am sure that

have the referendum. That is the crux of the

      I
support the Government on this issue this evening because not only are
we giving a generation of British voters, who have been denied
previously, the chance to have a say in such a referendum, but we are
actually putting historical injustices right and are allowing a
referendum to take place. To hear the Scottish National party preaching
about fairness earlier was a bit galling, when the no voters in the

      In
lifting the purdah provisions, we must bear it in mind that section 125
would stop the Government publishing material on any issue raised by

is so broad that it would prevent publication in relation to any issue
raised by the referendum. It could therefore prevent Ministers from
conducting the ordinary day-to-day business of the United
Kingdom’s dealings with the European Union. We have to bear in

best to define the scope of restrictions on such

the extent to which the rules should be set by Act, secondary

      Just as we in the Labour party have, for better or
worse, widened our franchise, so the widest possible franchise should
be involved in the referendum, which is likely to be held next year.
The Government have proposed that the referendum should not have the
same franchise as there was for the Scottish referendum, which was the
local government franchise, but should simply have the parliamentary
franchise. They propose restricting the franchise to those who vote in
parliamentary elections and not including some people who vote in local
government elections and in European Parliament elections, some people
who can vote in the London mayoral election next year and some who were
eligible to vote in the Scottish referendum in
2014.

      That is exactly the point addressed in amendment
20. People can vote in a European Parliament election if they are a
citizen of any of the 27 other European Union countries and are
resident in the UK. If the Government get their way, people who are
paying taxes in this country and living in this country, perhaps having
done so for decades, with children who were born in this country, and
who are perhaps married to British citizens but who happen to retain
the nationality they had when they came here from Italy, Germany,
France or one of many other countries, will not be able to vote in the
referendum which will affect their status and that of their family in
the UK.

      I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for reminding
me of that. We discussed this issue in Committee on 18 June, when
exactly that point was made. Two million EU citizens are living in this
country and many of them will not be able to vote in the referendum
which will directly affect their future, although if they are from the
Republic of Ireland, Cyprus or Malta, they will be able to vote. A
Greek Cypriot will be able to vote in the referendum but a Greek person
from one of the many islands in the archipelago around Athens will not
be able to. We face the absurd situation of a discrimination that
affects the livelihoods and future prosperity of those
people.

      That is absolutely right. Just as there are more
than 2 million EU citizens living in the UK, more than 2 million
British citizens are living in other EU countries. Some of them will
have registered to vote as overseas voters under the existing law,
which allows people who have been abroad for up to 15 years to vote in
parliamentary elections. Some thousands of people do that, but the bulk
of them do not. British people who have been living in Portugal, Spain,
Germany, Cyprus, Greece or France for more than 15 years are not going
to be eligible to vote in a referendum that could seriously damage
their prospects of being allowed to stay in those countries and have
rights there, should the British people vote in the referendum that we
leave the EU. Many overseas voters are incensed about that. There is an
organisation called Labour International with which I am associated,
and a similar organisation for the Conservatives. I know that those
voters have been sending communications for months saying that 
this is a democratic outrage, that the Government will damage their
future and that they will have no say on their position.

      Ironically,
the Conservative party said in its election manifesto that it was going
to get rid of the 15-year rule, yet the Conservative
Government—they cannot even blame the Liberal Democrats for
this—are introducing legislation in effect to disfranchise many
British people who will no longer have a say in their future within the
European Union. That is undemocratic. It is outrageous that British
people’s futures will be affected. As the right hon. Member for
Carshalton and Wallington (Tom Brake) said, if we leave the European
Union, there will be two groups of people who will be particularly
badly affected. I am talking about EU citizens living in the UK who may
have British-born children, and British citizens living in other

area that might help us to achieve that gold standard is votes for 16

vote on it tonight. There are benefits to involving young people at an
early stage in the political process. Let us not forget that when we
have a European Union referendum, those aged 16 and 17 will have to
live with the consequences of that decision for a whole lot longer than

That was set out by First Minister Nicola Sturgeon to the European
Policy Centre on 2 June. I encourage all Members to read that speech.
As well as considering areas for reform in which powers can be returned
to the member states or, indeed, to the devolved Administrations, let
us consider areas in which we could work more closely together, such as
energy or climate change.

      I rise to speak on the issues of the independence
of broadcasting and campaign funding covered by two of the new clauses.
It is most important that we should have a fair referendum and I think
that the House has made a wise decision this evening to further that
aim. I hope that the nation’s leading broadcaster, the BBC, will
enter into the spirit of wanting that fair campaign and will study and
understand where those who wish to stay in and those who wish to leave
are coming from. It needs to learn that in the run-up to the referendum
campaign proper as well as in the campaign itself. My hon. Friend the
Member for Stone (Sir William Cash) has tabled a suitable new clause to
try to ensure that that happens and I hope that the Minister will share
our wishes and might have something to say on this point.

      I notice that
in recent months it has been absolutely statutory for practically every
business person being interviewed on business subjects and subjects of
great interest to consumers and taxpayers to be asked for their view of
whether their business would be ruined if we left the European Union.
The question is always a leading question and they are treated as
somewhat guilty or suspect if they do not immediately say yes, of
course, their business would be ruined if we were to leave the European

      It would be far too dangerous for me to speculate
on that without more factual information at my disposal. My hon. Friend
is being slightly mischievous. I could not possibly agree with him and
call into question how people are invited to BBC interviews. However,
it is interesting that the one argument that the campaign to stay in
the EU seems to have—that leaving the EU would be bad for
business and jobs would be lost—has become a constant refrain in
all BBC interviews.

      The BBC seems
devastatingly disappointed when a lot of businesses take the opposite
view. It was fascinating to hear the wonderful interview with Nissan
last week. The whole House will welcome the great news that Nissan has
a very big investment programme for the United Kingdom’s biggest
car plant, which will carry it through the next five years and beyond
with a new model. When the BBC tried to threaten that investment by
asking, “Wouldn’t you cancel it if the British people
voted to come out of the EU?”, Nissan said, “No, of
course we wouldn’t.” It is about the excellence of the
workforce, the excellence of the product and access to an extremely
good market here. It is in no way conditional upon how people in
Britain exercise their democratic
rights.

      It
is that spirit—the spirit of Nissan—that I hope the BBC
will wish to adopt when contemplating such interviews in future. I hope
that it will understand that most business interviews over the next few
months should not be about the politics of the EU; they should be about
whether the company is doing well—creating 
jobs, making profits and investing them wisely. If the business is
misbehaving, then by all means the interview should be about the
allegations.

      I never said that there is a conspiracy, and I
have not suggested that there is one figure in the BBC who holds that
view; I think that most people in the BBC hold that view, and I think
that it is quite spontaneous. I think that in some cases they are not
even aware that they are doing it. I note that many Members, including
on the Opposition Benches, are nodding their heads wisely. They, too,
have heard such interviews. It now seems almost a statutory requirement
in what should be interviews on general business subjects to regard
those people as having a unique insight into our future in the European
Union, ascribing to them supernatural powers that apparently the
millions of other voters in the country do not share, asking them to
dictate the future. I think that the referendum is a democratic process
and that everyone’s vote is of equal weight and value. It is a
conversation for the whole country. I am not against business people
joining in, because I am a democrat, and they have voices; I just think
that it is a bit odd that our leading broadcaster wants to turn every
business interview into a political
interview.

      I am charitable to the BBC and do not think that
it sets out to be biased in its coverage. The problem—I am not
entirely sure how my right hon. Friend will tackle this point—is
that it sets out to talk only to people from the same metropolitan set,
and they all have the same opinions. The people in the BBC need to get
out more and discover that across the country there are opinions
different from those of that narrow band of people. How does he think
they can address that? It is not conscious bias; they just need to get
out
more.

whether the right hon. Gentleman was as acutely aware of that bias
among business leaders 
during the Scottish referendum campaign, when they were wheeled out

      If the hon. Gentleman cares to check
johnredwoodsdiary.com, my blog, he will see that I wrote on that very
subject during the Scottish campaign ahead of the referendum and made
very similar points to the ones I am making now about the role of
business, where it can help and where it cannot. He will be
disappointed to learn that I believe in being consistent. It has been
one of my problems in politics, trying to be consistent, and if one
seeks to combine consistency with being right, it can be absolutely
devastating. I must now teach myself humility and realise that no one

      That would be appropriate if they were doing a
package on attitudes towards Europe, for example; or it would be
appropriate during the referendum campaign to have business voices as
well as political voices and others—but not in every interview
that is meant to be about a business subject. BBC reporters do not
choose to do that every time a social worker is on to talk about a
social work case, or some local government worker is on. They do not
immediately ask, “What would happen to your job if we left the
EU?” There is something quite odd about it. Very often, the
business matters that are being discussed have nothing to do with
foreign trade. Nor do I understand why the right hon. Gentleman and
some others wish to mislead and threaten the British people into
thinking that our trade would be at risk, because clearly it would not
be at risk. All of us wish to trade with Europe and be friends with
Europe, but some of us wish to have a relationship with people in the
European Union that allows their euro to evolve into the political
union that they want without dragging Britain in and losing our
democracy in the
process.

      Of course coming out of the EU will have an
impact on the conduct of the public sector in Britain, as well as on
the private sector. It will change who makes the laws and how the
budgets are run, for example. If we did not have to send £11
billion a year to the EU to be spent elsewhere, we would have more
scope to have better social work and tax cuts in the United Kingdom. I
think that would be extremely good news. Why are public service workers
not asked whether they would rather see some of that money spent on 
their preferred public service than sent to be spent elsewhere in the
European Union? That line of questioning would be just as interesting
as the one trotted out each time for business people: “Will your
business come to an end if the British people dare to vote for
democracy?”

      Is not the point that the BBC tries to show that

that many businesses want to leave the EU? The BBC always seems to be

      That is a good point. The other constitutional
point I would make about businesses is that in an entrepreneurial
business where the entrepreneur-owner-manager owns 51% or more of the
shares, of course they speak for business, so if they say, “I
want to stay in,” or, “I want us to pull out,”
that is not only their view but the view of the whole business. I can
understand that and it is very interesting, but quite often the people
being interviewed are executives with very few shares in very large
companies, who have not cleared their view through a shareholder
meeting or some other constitutional process. The BBC wishes to give
the impression that that is the view of all the members of the company,
whereas in fact it is just the opinion of an executive. It is
interesting, and the executive may be quite powerful, but he does not
necessarily speak for the company, and that is never stressed in the
exchanges.

often, what is interesting is which questions are not asked, as well as
those that are asked and the people who are put on? For example, some
of us have for a long time been making the argument, based on House of

Germans run a surplus with the other 27 member states of

      I am being tempted into byways on the substance
of the debate in the forthcoming referendum, but my hon. Friend is
absolutely right. We would like to hear more questioning of our deficit
and a reminder that we are the customers more than the producers; it is
the other way round for the Germans. It is unusual for the customers to
be in a weak position and the producers in a strong
position.

      We
should remember that we are the customer country in the European Union
and that the customer used always to be right. Perhaps we should have
rather more care taken over our attitudes because we are the customer,
as a heavy net contributor to the European Union, and we would like to
hear more questions about what are the other possibilities. What could
we do with the money if we were not paying it in? What would happen to
our trade deficit were we no longer inside the Union? The answer is
that we would still have a big trade deficit with the European Union
because trade would continue on exactly the same basis as it has so far
throughout our 
partial membership. Of course, we are not in Schengen and not in the
euro, so we are already in a different position.

      I and many
others want us to have a good relationship with the European Union, but
to recognise that it is now driven by the euro. Britain is not about to
join the euro, and therefore does not want or need the political union.
I am very pleased that our Prime Minister is trying to sort out a new
relationship. That had to done. Any sensible person, wherever they are
on the spectrum of European-ness or pro-EU-ness, should see that this
is a crucial moment in the future of the European Union where we need
to sort out our relationships, so that we do not impede the EU but it
does not make too many decisions on our behalf that the British people

      On funding, to
make sure that we have a campaign that is fair and perceived to be
fair, we need to avoid the European Union itself spending any money or
putting forward any propaganda during the campaign period. We also need
to make sure that the spending limits on the political parties and the
two main campaign teams are fair. I have no problem if one side raises
more money than the other within the limits and is able to use
it—that is the advantage of being more popular and that is the
system we use. However, it is also fair to have some overall limit, as
the Government are proposing. We need to be careful that the cumulative
limits between different political parties and actors on one side do
not become disproportionate, with the other side limited in the amount
it can raise so that the thing is out of balance.

      I would like
my hon. Friend the Minister to say a little more about how the two

“leave” campaign, for example, did not have lots of
political parties adding to its funding, and obviously did not have the
European Union adding to it, and was then limited too much as a formal
campaign. It would not be perceived as fair if one side was spending
three times as much as the other under legal rules, and the other side
was constrained. I hope that he will consider that and realise that we
need a fair system so that people think it is a good
result.

      The referendum
will be a major constitutional decision that will have a bearing on
Britain’s future for decades to come. None of us expects it to
be a regular event like local elections, elections to Assemblies, or
elections to this House. It has been 40 years since the last such
referendum and such a vote on our constitutional future is a
once-in-a-generation decision. The result will affect every young
person in the UK for decades to come. At the moment, British citizens
have the right to live, work and study in any EU member state. One of
the main motivations—if not the main motivation—for those
seeking to leave the European Union is to end the principle of free
movement of people and to impose 
stricter controls on immigration. In the context of our leaving and
restrictions coming into play, it is hard to see how such a move would
not be reciprocated towards our own citizens and their ability to live,
work and study in the remaining European Union. The rights,
opportunities and freedoms of young people for decades to come are very
much on the ballot paper in this
referendum.

      The right hon. Gentleman seems to be arguing that
16 and 17-year-olds should have a vote because the referendum will
impact on young people for decades to come. It will presumably also
have a massive impact on my 12 and 10-year-old sons. By the same logic,
he will be arguing that they should have a vote, too. Why should the
vote be extended just to 16 and 17-year-olds? He seems to be arguing
for complete
nonsense.

      The argument has the benefit of not only
principle, but recent experience. While I do not share the view of
every member of the Scottish National party about all the virtues of
last year’s referendum, extending the vote to 16 and
17-year-olds worked well. No one on either side of the debate in that
referendum would argue that 16 and 17-year-olds did not understand the
issues, engage in the debate and carry out their vote, whether for yes
or for no, in a responsible manner. For those reasons, we believe that
the vote in this referendum should be extended to 16 and 17-year-olds,
and that there are specific reasons for doing so on such a long-term
constitutional decision such as this which go above and beyond the
general debate about the voting
age.

      I want to deal with that issue and the comments
of the hon. Gentleman and my hon. Friend the Member for Ilford South
(Mike Gapes). The contribution made to this country by EU citizens is
not disputed by me or any Opposition Front Bencher. What my hon. Friend
said about that positive contribution and people paying taxes is
absolutely true. It is also true of the many British people living and
working in other EU member states. I completely agree with him that the
argument is not about contribution, value, rewinding the clock or any
of the other general points. The issue is about precedents in other
referendums concerning such matters in other countries. We looked at
the precedents and every referendum we found regarding accession to the
European Union, joining the single currency or European treaty change
was restricted to citizens of the relevant member state. That does not
mean that they think that citizens of other countries living in that
state do not make a contribution or pay taxes and are not valuable
citizens, but that precedent has been set time after time when
countries make significant decisions about their own
future.

      My right hon. Friend referred to precedents. Is it
not the fact that in our elections and presumably in the referendum
that took place in 1975, citizens of other countries who are not
British citizens have participated, because we allow Commonwealth
citizens, such as the citizens of Malta and Cyprus, and citizens of the
Republic of Ireland to participate? There are problems with a
definition that relates only to citizens of this country. I accept that
there is a parliamentary franchise, which is the position that the

      My good and hon. Friend anticipates my reply. He
is right that history comes into play here, and not always in a linear
manner. The thing that unites citizens of the Republic of Ireland and
the other examples he mentioned is that they are part of the
parliamentary franchise. He is right to say that it is not strictly
about citizenship, but about who can vote to elect a national
Parliament.

      It
remains the case that throughout the European Union when countries have
had referendums of this type they have not extended the vote to
citizens of other countries. It is important to state that, because too

Gentleman is saying. He seems to be saying that there should be no

      On the date of
the referendum, we have said all along that it should not be held when
other important elections are taking place. In Committee, the House
accepted a Government amendment ruling out the date of the elections
due in May 2016. Our amendment 15 would also rule out holding it on the

      Government
amendment 23 deals with the new question wording put forward last week
by the Electoral Commission. The Opposition respect the work of the
Electoral Commission. Its job is to examine referendum questions and to
comment on them. We therefore accept the change it suggests, but may I
ask the Minister a couple of questions? Has he asked the Electoral
Commission why it was appropriate to approve the question
“Should Scotland be an independent country?” on a yes/no
basis without an alternative statement about remaining part of the
United Kingdom being deemed necessary? Has he asked why a yes/no
question was approved for the referendum on the alternative vote a few
years ago, but is not deemed appropriate this time? Does he know if
this decision should be considered a one-off for this referendum, or
whether we should 
expect all future referendums to be a choice between two alternative
statements, rather than yes/no in answer to a proposition, as has often
been the case in the past? As I said, we accept the new wording, but
would like to know more about the reasons behind it and the contrast in
the approach taken with other recent
referendums.

      Amendment
16 calls for a White Paper to be published outlining the terms of any
renegotiation settlement the Prime Minister has reached and the
consequences for the UK of leaving the European Union. We believe this
is important because the referendum needs to examine not only our
current relationship with the EU but what leaving might mean for the
UK. This, too, was touched on in Committee. The Minister for Europe
indicated at that point that the Government might produce a White
Paper. May I press him on this tonight? Has further thought gone into
that, and can he tell the House definitively that that will be the
case? This is important, because voters deserve as much information as
possible about what the decision on Britain’s future means. This
will in the end be a choice between two futures and there should be
information about both of them. Our amendment states that such a White
Paper should be published at least 10 weeks before the poll, well away
from any of the discussions about purdah, which applies to the final 28
days of the referendum period. We are not calling for Government
information to be sent to every household, or for this to be a
last-minute intervention. We are saying that at least 10 weeks from the
poll it will be important to have a proper view on remaining and
leaving. What does anyone advocating leaving have to fear from the
consequences of doing so being set out in a White
Paper?

      I begin by referring
particularly to my amendment on the impartiality of broadcasters. It
will be observed that I have not confined my remarks exclusively to the
BBC. I am aware, having been on the Broadcasting Bill in the 1990s,
that the broadcasters have different regimes: the BBC has a royal
charter and the other broadcasters are regulated by statute. I
introduced an amendment to the second of the two Broadcasting Bills to
ensure impartiality that was accepted by the now Baroness Bottomley
when she was Secretary of State. Impartiality is a fundamental
necessity in relation to the function of broadcasters. Given that
£3.7 billion—I think—of the BBC’s total
annual income of over £5 billion comes from the taxpayer, I
think the taxpayer has an absolute right to be certain that there is no
manoeuvring and completely unbiased reporting and comment.

      I was deeply
disturbed, as Chairman of the European Scrutiny Committee, when I set
up an inquiry into the BBC’s handling of European issues,
against a background that I will explain in a moment, when the right
hon. Lord Patten, then BBC Chairman, refused three times to appear
before the Committee. I had effectively to 
require him to do so through the aegis of the Liaison Committee, which
unanimously supported my proposal. I had exactly the same experience
with Lord Hall, who also refused three times. I again had to use the
aegis of the Liaison Committee to ensure he appeared, which eventually
he did. On the other hand, Rona Fairhead, who is now the Chairman of
the BBC Trust and who did not have the protection of being a Member of
the House of Lords, did appear. The correspondence, which is set out in
our report, is interesting to read. Whatever the excuses given, both
Lord Hall and Lord Patten, as Members of the House of Lords, were in a
position to refuse a summons from a Select Committee. This seemed
completely extraordinary, and eventually, through the good offices of
the then Chairman of the Liaison Committee and others, both of them did
eventually acquiesce, although Lord Patten subsequently resigned
because of ill health. The bottom line is that it was a very serious
situation.

      It has been
claimed in evidence to us, which I am now slightly paraphrasing, that
the BBC is effectively completely independent. This is simply not the
case. First, it has to report to Parliament. Secondly, its
representatives ought to appear in front of Select Committees. I have
to say that they do appear before the Public Accounts Committee and the
Culture, Media and Sport Committee, but I am talking about the European
dimension, which is my main concern and which is relevant to the
conduct of the Bill, and to how the taxpayer will be affected if there
is not complete

late Hugo Young, whom I knew extremely well, wrote a book called
“This Blessed Plot”. I knew him since we were about 10
years old. We both lived in Sheffield and more or less grew up together

      I do not know what to say. That is true. I
did not know it was going to be written. In a discussion over lunch
during the Maastricht period, I heard Hugo Young, one of the greatest
journalists of his generation, say “Bill, you’ve got
      <I>
       The Daily Telegraph
      </I>
      ,
      <I>

      and the

      ; we’ve got the BBC.” I thought
that was pretty revealing. The bottom line is that there is a serious
concern here, although I believe it is now potentially capable of being
remedied.

      The
BBC remains the most important source of news for the country. An Ofcom
survey in 2013 noted that 34% of those who consume news named BBC 1 as
the most important news source to them. According to Ofcom’s
calculations, the BBC has the highest share of each of the platforms on
which it has a presence— 56% on television, 64% on radio
and 27% on the internet. As reflected in the conclusions of the
European Scrutiny Committee report, after evidence was taken from wide
sources, 58% of the public look to the BBC for the news they trust.
This is very important, and we 
need to be certain about the degrees of impartiality maintained during
the referendum campaign—not only for taxpayers and licence
payers, but for voters, 58% of whom, as I say, look to the BBC for the
news they trust. It is a hugely important

      Correspondence
published recently by the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and
Sport, following the report of the European Scrutiny Committee, is also
important. I sent a copy to him as well as to the Prime Minister and
others. The Secretary of State wrote to the chairman of the BBC Trust,
which has the responsibility for enforcing BBC standards. He said that
the corporation’s coverage of Europe had not been
“faultless” in the past. A committee had been set
up—in 2005, I believe—called the Wilson committee, which
was extremely critical of the manner in which the BBC covered European
issues. I was not surprised when I discovered from another
source—I hope I am right in quoting it—that when it comes
to newspapers, people in the BBC tend to come from what might be called

      There is a case, which my right hon. Friend
the Member for Wokingham (John Redwood) touched on earlier, relating to
the business news. In its report, our Committee referred to the
business section which comes on at about six o’clock in the

putting forward the pro-EU case. Given that the charter itself is under

this question as part of the review, and that includes addressing the
question of public purposes.

which a chartered body operates is by reference to the objects of the

a statutory instrument: they must have regard to what the charter says.

      There have been suggestions, of course, that
the BBC has been in receipt of money from the EU. My hon. Friend the
Member for North East Somerset (Mr Rees-Mogg), who is not in his seat
at the moment—he usually is—put that question to Mr
Harding, and we were hoping we would get further information on the
matter. We have, however, invited Lord Hall to return and he will be
coming back to see the Committee quite soon. He has accepted the
invitation this time—he has not been required to
appear—and we are looking forward to getting an answer to that
question, and many
others.

      Perhaps when Lord Hall does appear, we might put
a point to him about choosing interviewees, which is just as relevant
in respect of businesses. We might suggest that when the BBC is seeking
an anti-European Union viewpoint, it should not always go to members of
UKIP, because there are members and supporters of all
parties—not just the Conservative party, but the Labour party,
too—whose views it could, and should, be
seeking.

      The hon. Member for Luton North (Kelvin
Hopkins) and other Labour Members on my Committee put that very
question to the witnesses—Lord Hall and Mr Harding in
particular, as well as Rona Fairhead—because it is essential
that all sides of the 
arguments are heard. As I have said repeatedly in this debate, this is
not a party political issue in the sense that it is not Conservative
versus Labour. The very fact that the referendum has been set up and
the question is “Do you want to remain in or leave?”
means that it is a national issue and therefore all the broadcasting
authorities, including the BBC, must have regard to the fact that we
are passing over in this Bill the entire conduct of the referendum.
That means it must be conducted not on a party political basis, but on
yes versus no and on the question: “Do you want to remain in or
do you want to leave?” Therefore there must be impartiality. We
do not just want a Eurosceptic view. Some might think,
“I would want that, wouldn’t I?” but
actually, no; it must be done on an impartial
basis.

      It
is rather strange that the BBC was somewhat dismissive of News-watch,
an organisation that runs a comprehensive analysis of all news
programmes—who goes on, what questions are asked and the whole
conduct of the BBC output. I am afraid that it seems to me that the BBC
was somewhat dismissive of that, to say the least. I believe from what
I have heard that the BBC does not in fact have its own monitoring
system. If it does not have its own monitoring system, how is anybody
to know whether or not it has been impartial, because that is like
looking for a needle in a haystack? We do not have the facilities to be
able to conduct the analysis for ourselves, but the BBC has £5
billion and I would have thought that was the least it could
do.

asked earlier—although I might of course have
overlooked his comments on this on billcash.com? Does he now regret the

      To return to
my point, there is the facility for this if the BBC steps up to the
mark and does in full what the Wilson committee report recommended and,
more than that, what is in line with what the Secretary of State is now
proposing. This is a hugely important question given that according to
the BBC 53% of the British people depend on it for the news they
trust.

      Would the hon. Gentleman accept, however, that
apparently with the sole exception of the right hon. Member for
Wokingham (John Redwood), there was broadcast silence from Conservative
Members when there were dramatic examples of corporation
bias during the Scottish referendum coverage? With all due
respect, I never heard the hon. Member for Stone (Sir William Cash)
utter a cheep in complaint about that, which makes us feel a trifle
cynical about his motivation. One feels that it might just be about
Europe rather than bias.

      The
BBC recently published an annual report that was rather critical of the
fact that Select Committees ask questions about the BBC’s
performance on so-called editorial independence. I am not denying that
it is important that the BBC should have a degree of independence in
order to be impartial, but I think I have made the case that there has
not been the complete impartiality that we believe the BBC should
deliver to the British public. That is perhaps the result of
the lack of a monitoring system, or perhaps
because of a certain cultural bias of the kind that my hon. Friend
the Member for Shipley (Philip Davies) mentioned, and we can
see it in the evidence that we have accumulated in the European
Scrutiny Committee and in the reports of

      I shall speak relatively briefly to the SNP
amendments put forward by my hon. Friend the Member for North East Fife
(Stephen Gethins). As he said, the rules, regulations and conduct of
the Scottish independence referendum represent a gold standard for
referendums and political engagement more generally.

      When the EU
referendum does reach the streets and town halls of the UK, Members in
this Chamber might be in for a bit of a surprise about people’s
willingness to engage in that debate. Key to that political engagement
is the right of 16 and 17-year-olds not only to vote but to participate
in the debate. They galvanised and energised the debate on the
independence referendum. Their generation will have to live with the
consequences of this vote for longer than any of us, so it is only
right that they should be included. The Scottish Parliament has just
enfranchised 16 and 17-year-olds with the vote. As a result, a
16-year-old in my constituency faces being able to vote in the Scottish
Parliament elections in 2016 and in the local government elections in
2017 but being denied the right to vote in the EU referendum, which
will fall at some point between or shortly after those
elections.

      That leads us
to the question of timing, where the Government seem to have been
scrambling to keep up with the demand for clarity. At the last stage
they had to confirm that the referendum would not clash with the
Scottish Parliament or Welsh Assembly elections, and now they are
introducing amendments to say that it will not clash with local
elections specifically planned for 4 May 2017. The SNP
amendment asks for a clear three months on either side. There are good
reasons for that, not least the amendment that has just been passed on
purdah, because of course a purdah period will also apply to the
Scottish Parliament elections. Perhaps the Minister can advise us on
what will apply in advance of local government and London mayoral
elections, but either way we are looking at having two purdah periods 
in a relatively short time, depending on the date
the Government choose. That can be avoided by accepting the SNP
amendment and giving ourselves those three months clear on either side
before another election takes place.

      There are
additional benefits to having that clear run-up to the date of the
referendum. I saw major benefits in holding the Scottish independence
referendum in September, not least because it gave us a good long
period of campaigning during the glorious summer for which Scotland is
renowned and which it experiences every year but experienced
particularly last year during the Commonwealth games. That led
literally to engagement on the streets, with stalls, petitions and
conversations that would not have happened if the referendum had come
in May. But the precise month is less relevant to this than the length
of time available; no matter the exact date, what was crucial was the
good period of time available for a free and full debate.

      Allowing
three months on either side of the referendum gives it the respect and
the place that it is due in our national discourse. I think some
Members on the Labour Benches have been surprised to see so many people
filing out town halls because of an election. Such a thing is no
surprise to us in Scotland who have seen a democratic reawakening and
an engagement with the political process that was brought about by our
independence referendum. We have the opportunity now to do the same
thing. It does not matter what we believe in or how we vote in the
referendum. Like my right hon. Friend the Member for Gordon (Alex
Salmond), I am pro-European to my fingertips, and I look forward to
shedding light on the positive case for remaining in the European
Union. No matter what side we support in the EU referendum, we should
allow that space and time to be made
available.

      We
do not want the referendum to be conflated with any other vote that may
be taking place. The Government may want to cast their mind back to the
alternative vote referendum, which was completely lost in
Scotland—perhaps rightly so—in the debate on the Scottish
elections. Elsewhere in the UK, the vote effectively became a
referendum on the popularity of the Con-Dem coalition, and it went
decidedly against the result that the Deputy Prime Minister wanted.
Perhaps in 2017, or whatever date is picked, the Prime Minister should
consider whether he wants this vote to turn into a referendum on the
popularity of the Government rather than on the question of the
UK’s membership of the European union.

      Finally, in
an earlier intervention, I mentioned new clause 3, which has not been
selected but which makes a very important point. It called for a double

      That is quite an interesting proposition and it is
certainly worth considering. We were told that Scotland should be
leading, not leaving, the UK. If we are to have a respect agenda and a
family of nations, perhaps that is the kind of thing that we should be
considering. As I said earlier, it is precisely the principle that this
Government want to introduce in their proposals for English votes for
English laws. Therefore, legislation, which can always be revisited and
amended in different ways, will be subject to a double majority in this
House, but a fundamental, decisive and long-term principled decision on
our membership of the European Union will be denied that opportunity of
a double majority when we are trying to decide the future of the United
Kingdom and its role in the modern
world.

      Like
much of what we have tried to do in this House since being elected, the
SNP has tabled amendments on the basis of what we were told during the
independence referendum. We heard that Scotland was a valued member of
the family of nations and that we should be leading the UK, not leaving
the UK. But we now face the prospect of Scotland’s 16 and
17-year-olds and European Union citizens being denied a vote on this
matter of vital importance. The date of the referendum is being chosen
on a whim to suit the political expediencies of the Government rather
than to allow a free and fair debate. Worst of all, Scotland’s
citizens will be forced to leave the European Union even if they vote
to stay in. That does not suggest a respect agenda. It might be that
some of us see that as the kind of material change that requires a
fresh evaluation of Scotland’s place in the United
Kingdom.

the gold standard of a referendum process should be. I hope that the

my amendment 53 in Committee, before our summer break.

      Although
there has been a lot of fire and emotion and a vote tonight about
purdah, the question of spending by both sides is probably more
important. Lord Lamont, the former Chancellor, has written a number of
articles about it. It is incredibly important when we have the
referendum that we get a sense of closure. At the end of
this, whatever the result, people should feel that it has been broadly
fair. Otherwise, we might reap the whirlwind. We should remember what
happened after 
the Scottish referendum. If the yes campaign should
win, we do not want to create a sense of unfairness for the other
side.

      I know that
my hon. Friend the Minister has taken seriously the points I have put
to him. In our earlier debates, the way he put it was that there should
be a “broad equality” of forces, but we fear that that
simply will not happen. Although there are sensible, firm and clear
limits on how much public money will be available to the no and yes
campaigns—say, £600,000 or something on each
side—and that is completely fair, the party establishment of the
main political parties, the Conservative party, the Labour party, the
Liberal party, and the SNP, will almost certainly campaign to stay in
Europe. Their ability to spend will be based on the votes that they
got, with the Conservative party allowed to spend £5 million,
the Labour party £4 million, the UK Independence
party only £3 million—they will be the only people on
the other side—and the Liberal Democrats £2
million. We could reach a situation in which the yes campaign is
spending up to £17 million and the no campaign only £8
million.

      That has
already happened once before. In 1975, the no side was outspent 10:1,
which simply cannot be fair. When I put those points to my hon. Friend
the Minister in the past, he said that although he accepted that
morally and logically there was force in my arguments, that was not in
our tradition, as we do not have limits for general elections. I am
sure that he will make the same argument again tonight. However, a
general election is somewhat different. Separate political parties all
have their own position that they are putting forward, rather than
ganging up, in a sense, on one side of the argument. There is no sense
of unfairness at the end of the process, or a sense that one important
political point of view has been massively outspent by the other
side.

      Although I
accept that the Minister will make those arguments, I hope he will feel
that there is some sort of moral force in what we have said. For
instance, the official yes side in the AV referendum spent
£3.436 million and the official no side spent £2.995
million. There was a broad equality in what the yes campaign and no
campaign were spending on the AV referendum, was there not? I think we
all felt it was a fair referendum. The arguments were put, there was a
clear decision and people accepted it. Surely we do not want to be in
the situation that has arisen with so many other referendums in Europe,
in which there is a sense that the political establishment—the
European establishment—has a massive imbalance of resources on
its side when it comes to spending. That creates a sense after the
referendum that it has somehow been unfair.

With regard to votes at 16 and 17, I will not repeat the arguments that
have already been set out on Second Reading and in this debate, but
clearly it is something we support. One of the fundamental reasons why
we support votes at 16 and 17 in the EU referendum is that young people
could be deprived of the benefits of our EU membership, such as the
ability to live and work abroad. That would be extremely regrettable,
because it would close down their options.

      Amendments 20
and 21 were tabled by the hon. Member for Ilford South (Mike Gapes),
who is no longer in his place. I assume that he did so—I support
him in this—to try to initiate some sort of debate, because one
thing that is sorely lacking in debates on our membership of the EU is
the impact that pulling out would have on UK citizens who live
elsewhere in the EU and on other EU citizens who live in UK. I think
that he was trying to trigger that debate, because those who support
leaving the European Union have to start talking about that. It is only
fair that they set out what they think the impact would be on the
millions of EU citizens who live in the UK, and on the millions of UK
citizens who live elsewhere in the European Union.

      When the
right hon. Member for Wolverhampton South East (Mr McFadden) referred
to precedent, I hope that he was not saying that the Labour party could
not move on the issue of votes for EU citizens in the UK simply because
there was no precedent for that anywhere else in the EU. If we always
waited for a precedent to be set, we would never do anything. I hope
that there are other reasons why the Labour party cannot support that,
although it was not entirely clear what they were. All he referred to
was the fact that precedents elsewhere in the EU were against that
happening.

      Government
amendment 23 relates to the wording of the referendum question. Like
the official Opposition, we accept the wording put forward by the
Electoral Commission, but we are disappointed that it is more
complicated than the original question. Indeed, the Electoral
Commission has suggested in its own findings that the change was not
necessary because there was no evidence to suggest that the original
question resulted in participants changing their voting preferences. I
am slightly confused about why the Electoral Commission then felt that
it was necessary to put forward an alternative and more complicated
question, but that is where we are and that is what it has set
out.

      I see the hon. Gentleman shake his head. I am sure
he has attended counts, looked at people’s ballot papers and
tried to work out the reasoning behind the decisions taken in for
example, crossing two boxes rather than one during a general election,
or in the more confused voting that takes place in elections where
there are multiple choices. The question and the way in which people
participate in the referendum does present challenges and lead to
difficulties, which is why a simpler question is always the better
choice. However, the Electoral Commission has recommended this
question, the Government are implementing its recommendations and, with
some misgivings, we will support that.

      It has been
put to me that if the EU institutions spent heavily in the referendum
campaign, it would greatly assist the campaign to leave, particularly
if some of the Commissioners came over on speaking tours and explained
their plans for a federal Europe. Notwithstanding that, it is a matter
of concern that the EU institutions might end up being the only
unregulated parties in the course of the campaign. I am therefore keen

      As
I said, the Government amendments on campaigning broadly have the
support of the Electoral Commission and will ensure that the Bill and
PPERA operate together and that campaigning is fair and transparent. On
designation and the time allowed for the campaign, we have proposed
changes which I hope will please my hon. Friend the Member for Stone
(Sir William Cash), as they address concerns he raised with me in
Committee and again this evening. He was worried that we should have a
full 16-week campaign and that designation should not eat into the
final 10-week short campaign period. I promised him that we would find
an answer to make sure that it did not. These changes mean that the
required statutory instrument to fix the date for the referendum
should, as is usual for an affirmative resolution, take six weeks to go
through the House. Only once that process is complete does the 10-week
short campaign period start. Obviously, six plus 10 equals 16. I hope
that my hon. Friend and others will be reassured that we will have
adequate time to debate during that entire 16-week period.

      Equally, it
is important that the designation process means that the decision on
who are the lead campaign groups for the in and the out campaigns is
properly arrived at that and those groups are clearly designated before
the start of the 10-week campaign, since that will allow them to access
the money that designation as lead campaign groups allows and also to
spend that money correctly to put their points as strongly as possible
during the last 10 weeks of the campaign. We have therefore decided to
table an amendment that will allow the designation process to be done
via a negative resolution and, if necessary, for that resolution to
take effect immediately on the day, at the latest, that the SI setting
the date for the referendum is tabled. That will mean that while the SI
setting the date is going through Parliament, the work by the Electoral
Commission to designate lead campaign groups can be going on in
parallel and will be complete on or before the start of the 10-week
period so that designation will be complete in time for the full 10
weeks to be carried out properly. I hope that that answers, very
briefly, the major concerns that were raised in Committee and again
here today.

      I should also
mention that the negative resolution I have described would need to
take effect very promptly on the day that it was tabled. That is
unusual; we usually wait for two to three weeks after tabling something
before it takes effect. I have already spoken to the Chairman of the
Joint Committee on Statutory Instruments to discuss the importance and
exceptionality of getting the provision to take effect immediately
rather than after three weeks. I look forward to working with him on
this wherever
possible.

      I
now move on to some of the non-Government amendments. Amendment 1, in
the name of my hon. Friend the Member for Stone, would require that the
referendum period be no shorter than 16 weeks. I hope we have already
dealt with that and therefore do not propose to dwell on it any more
strongly.

      Amendment 3,
also in the name of my hon. Friend, would require that the legislation
be clear at least six months before it is required to be
implemented or complied with. I think that his rationale is based on
the Electoral Commission recommendation that the rules be clear six
months before they are enforced. We can satisfy that recommendation in
a slightly brisker and less onerous fashion, because we have already
published the detailed draft regulations on how the vote should be
held. They have been available in the Commons Library since July, and
the Electoral Commission has been assessing them carefully too. The
rules will already have been extremely clear for six months by spring
next year, and I hope that that will give everybody plenty of chance to
consider and absorb the details and subtleties as needed. I hope that
my hon. Friend will therefore be able to withdraw his
amendment.

      New clause 11
deals with spending caps, which were mentioned by a number of
colleagues. The new clause would mean that all political parties
seeking to campaign in the referendum would not be able to spend, in
total, more than £14 million. This would replace the individual
spending limit set for political parties that register as permitted
participants under the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act
2000. I think that my hon. Friend the Member for Stone is seeking to
reduce the impact that political parties—presumably the major
ones—can have in campaigning in the referendum, but I am afraid
that the new clause would not necessarily achieve what he may intend.
For example, assuming that the 11 parties had secured
between them 99% of the general election vote, the Lib Dems and the UK
Independence party would find that their spending limit fell by between
55% and 60% compared with the levels currently set in PPERA,
and the Greens, Plaid Cymru and the Democratic Unionist party would
find their allocations falling by over 90%. Instead of £700,000
each, Plaid Cymru, for example, would be stuck with a limit of
£84,000.

      If political
parties wanted to get round my hon. Friend’s proposal they could
simply register several other permitted participants and funnel any
extra money that they might have into them. Their total spending would
be well above the limit that he suggests, and the new clause would not
be able to stop it. It also opens up the option for political game
playing, whereby parties may not want to campaign but simply register
to impact on and reduce the limits of other political rivals. That
would not reflect well on the quality of rules underpinning the
referendum. I therefore hope that he will be able to withdraw the new
clause.

      I
hope that I can reassure my hon. Friends in relation to the various
amendments on the European Commission’s role. For a start,
neither EU institutions nor foreign Governments are legally permitted
donors under UK election law, so any campaign group that took money
from them would be committing an offence. I note that the Electoral
Commission announced on Friday that it does not support the amendments
for that reason. There are well-tested rules, modelled on election
rules, to prevent anyone from circumventing that by using middlemen.
Equally, to take an example entirely at random, if my hon. Friends are
considering supporting the out campaign, I gently suggest that any
attempt by the EU to interfere in the campaign would be a huge boost to
my hon. Friends’ side, and although the EU is many things, it is
not stupid, so I suspect that it already understands that
point.

      Time
is very tight, but I propose to speak very briefly about the changes
proposed to broadcasters’ impartiality. I simply say that the
existing regulators already have many of the required powers; the
question is about turning principle into practice and getting them to
use those powers. I am delighted to confirm that my right hon. Friend
the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport has urged them to
do so. I therefore hope that we will not need to add any further
regulators to the panoply that already

      It is important to say that this has been a useful
and interesting debate. The real debate is of course yet to come for
the country. I will withdraw amendment 20, but the issues that I raised
are pertinent to our country’s democracy and are certainly of
great concern to the millions of British people living in other EU
countries, who feel that they are being disfranchised on a vital
decision that could affect their wellbeing and future. I beg to ask
leave to withdraw the
amendment.

      I want to extend my thanks to
the Speaker for selecting me for this Adjournment debate, for even at
this late hour the issue I intend to raise is highly important. I can
tell the Minister that even at this late hour, although the Gallery may
not be packed, a lot of people are watching this debate with real
interest and have been waiting for his performance, and mine, for some
hours
now.

      As
with most Adjournment debates, the reason for applying for it started
with issues raised by constituents. Their cases alone would have been
enough for me to want hold the debate, but, as so often, when one
starts to do one’s research one realises that something is not
just a problem in one constituency but is a national issue. I recognise
that others are pursuing similar campaigns. At the outset, I wish to
recognise the excellent work of Bliss, the Too Much, Too Soon campaign,
and the Summer Born campaign, as well as thousands of parents and
colleagues, for I recognise that in raising this matter I follow in the
footsteps of angels. I also want to praise the Department for Education
and the Minister for the work they have already undertaken on this
matter. The Minister will understand, however, that tonight I am going
to try to persuade him to go a little further.

      The
definition of a summer-born child is one born between 1 April and 31
August. The issue, in essence, is that children must enter education by
the September after their fifth birthday. So in a reception class
starting on 1 September this year, there could be a child born on 2
September 2010 and a child born 11 months later at the end of August
the following year. One might therefore expect a huge gulf to be seen
in development—a fact that is consistently borne out by studies.
It is well documented that summer-born children can suffer from
long-term development issues and a lag in educational standards. A DFE
study from last year showed that at the end of their first year
children defined as summer-born were at a significant disadvantage in
comparison with older children. The study shows that two thirds of
those born between May and August fail to meet minimum expected
standards in reading, writing, speaking, maths and other development
skills, compared with slightly less than a third for those born between
September and December.

      That is
understandably worrying for a parent of any child born in these months,
but equally worrying is that, while intuitively one might expect this
gap to decline as the child progresses through the education system,
many studies show that children who are young for their year are
typically still seeking to catch up at GCSE level and are less likely
to go to university. In June this year, an article published in the
      <I>
       Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry
      </I>
      confirmed the DFE
study’s findings that younger children were twice as likely to
have language and behavioural problems relative to their elder peers.
Interestingly, since I spoke about this on the radio at lunchtime, a
number of people have contacted my office.

      It is
noticeable also that Sutton Trust research shows that this issue
affects not only the poorest areas in our society but some of the
richest—it spreads across our 
society. As I am sure the Minister knows, it is not unknown for some
summer-born children to be told that they have special needs. Moreover,
the experience of being persistently outperformed by more developed or
older children can lead to serious confidence and inferiority
perceptions and bullying. Of course, all these risks are also faced by
premature children who are encouraged to start school before they are
ready.

      This
whole catalogue of issues and problems was personified for me in two
constituency cases. In the first, a summer-born child entered into
reception without any deferral, despite requests to our local council
to repeat their nursery years. It became clear that the child needed
longer to develop. Therefore, the parents, with the
headteacher’s support, using the guidelines in place, applied
for the child to repeat reception rather than move to year 1. The
admissions manager repeatedly stressed that the guidelines were not
statutory, but after pressure the request was eventually granted.
However, the council has said that the guidelines are not statutory,
and it is now telling the family that it may have to go through the
whole deferral process again in year 5. The possible consequence is
that the child may miss year 7 and go straight into a secondary school
in year 8, rejoining their original age
cohort.

      The
second constituency case was raised by Louise and Ian Hunter in
relation to their son Hugh. Hugh was born extraordinarily premature,
and has been the beneficiary of the neo-natal unit at St
George’s hospital and all its excellent staff. Hugh would not
have been ready to enter reception at age 4, so his parents sought to
defer it to age 5. One might have thought from knowing the medical
history that a letter from the parents would have formed the
substantial part of an application to defer his education and that very
little else would be required. However, yet again, the local council
told the parents that the guidelines were non-statutory, and that there
might be issues with other authorities if they chose to move house at
some stage. Indeed, the local authority appeared to say that
“non-statutory” means voluntary or optional. The local
council tried to claim that it needed a precedent to be able to follow
the guidelines or clear evidence that Hugh had special educational
needs before it could authorise a deferral. Finally, after a lot of
persuasion, notice was taken of the guidelines, but there was still
confusion over the process. Hugh was lucky to benefit from having
dedicated and conscientious parents, and 18 months after their original
application to defer, the council agreed to their
request.

      For
many years before the guidelines were published, the whole process was
mired in even more difficulty and uncertainty, so the way that the DFE
and Ministers have grasped this matter is entirely to their credit and
is much welcomed. However, it is clear that this matter remains far too
much of a lottery for many. The volume of emails I have received from
people from around the country this afternoon, following my performance
on “You and Yours” on Radio 4, shows that this concern is
not confined to those two constituency
cases.

Ireland, but the issues in the cases that he outlines are also apparent

summer-born

      Going
back to my performance on “You and Yours” today, several
people have emailed me since and I was particularly struck by a lady
who contacted me to say that she had triplets born prematurely at 25
weeks. They should have been born on 1 November, but she was told by
her local authority that if she delays their start to school, they will
have to go into year 1 rather than reception. That is despite the fact
that her children have been diagnosed by paediatricians as having
additional needs and developmental delay. Another lady got in touch to
tell me about her grandaughter who was born in August 2005 in Dublin.
In Ireland, as the Minister will know, parents can choose when a child
with an August birthday starts school, so the parents decided to delay
her entry into reception. A few years later, it was necessary for the
family to move to the UK, where the local authority has insisted that
the child starts school with her chronological age group in year 5,
thereby skipping year 4. That has caused huge distress and anxiety for
the child. Practice differs across the country, but the guidelines are
being followed inconsistently and it has become far too much of a
lottery.

      I spoke to my hon. Friend before
the debate to say that I would intervene, and I thank him for giving
way. My youngest son, William, started school today. He was born in
November and my wife and I just know that he is ready to start school.
Does my hon. Friend agree that the reason for such a response to his
stellar performance on Radio 4 this lunchtime is that this is
ultimately about parental choice? Parents know what is best for their
children and want greater control over when their children enter the
education
system.

      We
must look at the practice in other countries. In the Netherlands,
parents have the right to choose whether a child has one or two years
at kindergarten. In the USA, study at kindergarten can be delayed to
allow social, emotional, intellectual or physical growth. In some
German states, all children are required to be assessed by a
paediatrician or educational psychologist to check that they are ready
for school. I am not suggesting that we implement all those practices,
but it is clear that there is a recognition of these issues across a
number of
countries.

      Those
guidelines are a real step forward, but there is always a but. In this
case, the but is not about the guidelines; there are issues with how
the process is being operated in practice, there are concerns about the
attitudes of a number of councils and there is a feeling among many
parents that they are not getting a fair hearing or that the system is
operating a postcode

      Let
me briefly set out the issues with current practice. First, although
there is no statutory barrier to a child being admitted outside their
normal age cohort, there is no right to insist or to appeal. Although
the guidelines state that the rationale must be set out, they do not
confer any extra rights. Secondly, some authorities allow delayed entry
into education but then insist that the child begins in year 1, rather
than in reception, thus removing all the hoped-for benefit of starting
a year later. Thirdly, some authorities, as I pointed out when
describing the case in my constituency, allow a child to defer entry at
primary level but give no guarantee that the child will remain in that
cohort post-primary school. Finally, there are any number of similar
problems for the parents of premature and pre-term babies. Some local
authorities take no account of prematurity or the due
date.

      The
Education Committee noted in a report earlier this year that the number
of cases where children were being delayed and then admitted into year
1 rather than into reception had increased and that there was an
increase in the number of contentious
cases.

      Tonight,
I ask the Minister for minor tweaks that I think would have a
substantial impact on the lives of many children. I hope that those
tweaks will address the issues that I have described. I know that the
Minister has agreed to a review, so I ask him to look at revising the
guidelines in three ways. First, I ask that the due date, rather than
the birth date, of premature children be used in the definition or
interpretation of compulsory school age. Secondly, I ask him to
consider giving the parents of summer-born children an automatic right
to defer, given that parents have the best feeling for when their
children should enter education, with a similar provision for the
parents of premature children. Finally, 
I ask him to ensure that once a deferral has been agreed, the child
stays in the same educational cohort throughout their educational
career.

      If
the Minister feels that that is a “perfect world”, that
he cannot necessarily agree to all those suggestions, and that perhaps
one would be a step too far—although I do not think they
are—then surely the default position must be that the onus is
placed on the council to prove why a request should not be granted. I
hope the Minister will consider the three tweaks, which I regard as
relatively minor. Like supporters of the Summer Born and Too Much, Too
Soon campaigns, I have been hugely encouraged by the Minister’s
interest in this issue. Tonight—or this morning—we have
the chance, through those tweaks, to change many children’s
lives for the better. I hope the Minister will agree, in his comments
this morning, to look at those tweaks and to revise the guidelines
accordingly. We have the chance to make a change that will be of
benefit to so many
children.

        The
Minister for Schools (Mr Nick Gibb):
       </Member>
      </B>
      I congratulate my
hon. Friend the Member for Wimbledon (Stephen Hammond) on securing the
debate, and on choosing such an apposite time of the day in which to
have it. I also congratulate him on his very effective campaigning on
this issue, both for his constituents—Hugh Hunter and his
parents—and the other families he referred to. I congratulate
him on the fight he has put up on their behalf, and on his campaign
nationally on this very important issue. It is timely, as it allows me
the opportunity to set out the Government’s position on
summer-born children, and our intention to amend the school admissions
code to ensure that summer-born children do not miss out on an
important year of their education and schooling.

      The statutory
school admissions code currently requires admission authorities to
provide for the admission to school of all children in the September
following their fourth birthday. A child does not reach compulsory
school age until on or after their fifth birthday. No parent,
therefore, is obliged to send their child to school before that age is
reached. Most parents are happy for their child to begin school at the
age of four, but as we know, children develop at different rates,
particularly in the early years. Some parents will therefore feel that
their child is simply not ready to start school before compulsory
school age. To allow for this, the admissions code makes it clear that
parents can request that their child attend part time, or that their
entry be delayed, until they reach compulsory school
age.

     <hs_Para UID="15090820001446" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201516/cmhansrd/cm150907/debtext/150907-0005.htm#15090820001446">
      Where
parents of a summer-born child want that child to start school at the
age of five, as the law allows them to, they will start school at the
point when their peers are moving up from the reception class to year
1. If they want their child to be admitted to the reception class at
this point, they must currently request that they be admitted outside
of their normal age group. The admissions code requires the admission
authority to then make a decision on the age group the child should be
admitted to, based on the circumstances of the case and their best
interests. In making that decision, the admission authority is required
to take into account the views of the headteacher of the
school—as my hon. Friend explained—as they are best
placed to advise on the age group at their school in which the
child’s needs can best be met. The code also makes it clear that

admission authorities must take into account the wishes of parents,
alongside other information relating to the child’s academic,
social and emotional development.

      This,
however, is where problems seem to arise at a local level. The decision
on what age group the child should be admitted to often seems to be
problematic, with the parents and admission authority failing to agree
on what is in the best interests of the child. I am concerned about the
number of cases in which it appears that the wishes of parents are not
being respected and children are being admitted to year 1, rather than
the reception class, and are therefore missing out on the essential
teaching of reading and arithmetic which takes place in the reception
class.

      We have
always made it clear that there are no statutory barriers to admitting
summer-born children to a reception class at the age of five. In July
2013, we published non-statutory advice to help admission authorities
and parents understand the statutory framework within which decisions
must be made, and to remove the misunderstandings that appeared to get
in the way of admission authorities agreeing to parental requests. For
example, it clarified that a school’s funding would not be
affected if they admitted a child out of their normal age group, and
this advice seemed to be successful at dispelling such
misunderstandings, but unfortunately it did not result in a reduction
in the number of problematic cases, or the number of parents whose
wishes were
overruled.

      That
is why last year we amended the admissions code to provide greater
clarity about how such decisions should be made, and to improve
transparency for parents. The code now makes it clear that the decision
must be made in the best interests of the child. It also requires the
admission authority to take account of the views of the headteacher of
the school concerned, as they are best placed to advise on the age
group at their school. The code requires the admission authority to
publish the process for requesting admission out of the normal age
group, and to set out the reasons for its decision in each case for the
parents concerned. It also makes it clear that admission authorities
should take into account the wishes of parents, alongside other
information relating to the child’s
development.

      In
spite of these changes and the additional non-statutory advice we have
published alongside them, I am concerned about the number of cases in
which it appears that children are still being admitted to year 1
against their parents’ wishes and are, as a consequence, missing
out on that important reception year at school. I am also concerned
that some children who are admitted outside of their normal year group
are later expected to miss a year and move up against their wishes to
join the other children of the same age range—a point referred
to by my hon. Friend.
     </hs_Para>
     <hs_Para UID="15090820001451" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201516/cmhansrd/cm150907/debtext/150907-0005.htm#15090820001451">
      We have
therefore decided it is necessary to amend the admissions code further
to ensure that summer-born children can be admitted to reception at the
age of five, if this is what their parents wish, and to ensure that
those children are able to remain with that cohort as they progress
through school. We have already begun the work necessary to implement
the change. We will conduct a full public consultation in due course
and, subject to parliamentary approval, we will introduce these further
changes to ensure that no child is forced to start school before they
are ready.

     <hs_Para UID="15090820001452" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201516/cmhansrd/cm150907/debtext/150907-0005.htm#15090820001452">
      Admission
authorities may have been reluctant to agree to parental requests
because they felt it would open the floodgates—that large
numbers of parents of summer-born children would want them to be
admitted outside their normal age group—and that, as a
consequence, the admission system would become impossible to manage. I
do not believe this to be true. The reception year of school is the
final part of the early years foundation stage, and we know that most
parents are happy for their child to go to school at this point,
confident that they are ready for the challenge. We believe that only a
small proportion of parents of summer-born children wish them to be
admitted to reception at the age of five—for example, children
born in the late summer 
months or born prematurely. On that point—the first of the three
my hon. Friend made—I will further consider whether we can make
changes in relation to the due date versus the birth date of
prematurely born
children.

      I
now wish to inform the House that, on the basis of new information that

      It
is standing Ministry of Defence policy not to comment in detail on
submarine operations but, exceptionally, I can say that this incident
occurred because the submarine did not correctly identify the Karen as
a fishing vessel with nets in the water, and thus did not give her the
berth she would otherwise have had. Moreover, had the submarine been
aware of the incident at the time, which it was not, then the protocols
in place under the Code Of Practice For Submarine Operations In The
Vicinity Of Fishing Vessels would have required the submarine to
surface and remain on scene while the matter was
investigated.

      Notwithstanding
the enduring requirement to operate RN submarines in busy coastal
waters to guarantee our national security, this is the first incident
between an RN submarine and a fishing vessel since the code was
introduced in 1993. Having identified the specific circumstances, the
RN has already taken steps to further reduce the risk of such
circumstances happening again: the instructions issued to submarine
Commanding Officers (COs) have been updated to reflect the lessons
learned, which will also inform the training given to future COs. The
RN’s reporting procedures have been reviewed to enable it to
confirm more quickly whether or not a UK submarine was involved. These
new arrangements will enable the Ministry of Defence’s
established claims procedures to be invoked with minimal delay and the
matter fully
investigated.

      The
competitions for both the infrastructure provider and the construction
contracts were highly competitive. The winning bid for the
infrastructure provider offered a weighted average cost of capital
(WACC) of 2.497%, which is fixed, subject to the terms of the project
licence, until the first price review following construction. The
construction procurements delivered a target build cost which is
unchanged from that estimated in 2011. As a result, Thames Water now
estimates the project will lead to an average household customer bill
impact which will peak at £20 to £25 by the mid-2020s (in
2015 prices), of which £7 is already included within customer
bills. They also expect that their current average household bill for
water and wastewater services will remain at the same level, before
inflation, until at least 2020. This impact is considerably lower than
the maximum estimate of £70 to £80 given in the written

      Relative
to first-generation biofuels—those made from traditional crops,
starch, sugars or vegetable oil—advanced fuels have the
potential to deliver greater carbon savings without the same concerns
around food security and land use change. The advanced fuel
technologies, the winning projects will demonstrate, could reduce our
reliance on imported energy, by turning unwanted waste products into
valuable transport fuel, adding value to the UK economy and creating
jobs. According to an independent feasibility study, gains from the
domestic supply as a result of converting low value waste to high value
transport fuel could be worth up to £130 million Gross Value
Added (GVA) to the UK by 2030, and potentially up to £500
million per year including
exports.

      The
Government work to support positive and diverse representations of
people. The Government ran the Body Confidence Campaign from 2010-2015,
which aimed to raise awareness and understanding of body image and
challenge the cultural norms and gender stereotypes that so often
undermine people’s confidence and abilities. The Government
Equalities Office continues to promote and support positive and diverse

Government uphold the core principle of freedom of expression,
recognising the invaluable role a free press plays in our cultural and
democratic life. The Government do not interfere with what the press
does and does not publish, as long as the press abides by the law of
the land. However, this does not mean that newspapers can publish
anything with impunity. We have introduced a new system of independent
press self-regulation that protects press freedom while offering real
redress when mistakes are made. Both the industry and the Government
agree that independent self-regulation of the press is the way

      Photoshop
and image altering software is used widely across advertising,
marketing and other industries. While this can sometimes distort
reality and promote unrealistic and unattainable ideals of beauty and
perfection there are many legitimate creative reasons for altering
images of people. Abolishing image altering software infringes on the
freedom of the press and limits creative and artistic freedoms. Such
acute action does not take into account the many circumstances where
images of people are altered in any number of ways to promote diverse
ideas or points of view and to create art and artistic representations
that include images of people. It is not possible to monitor image
manipulation carried out by individuals who create art, web pages or
publications across many media, both digital and
print.

      We
believe the most effective action to challenge limited, sexist or
stereotyped portrayals of people in media is led by consumer pressure
rather than banning editorial content. We have seen evidence that the
best way to encourage effective and lasting change is to encourage
industry to change from within, not only because it is the right thing
to do, but also because listening to what the public wants and engaging
with consumers is good for
business.

      A Help to Buy ISA will help those saving for a
deposit to have a better chance of owning their own home.
      <B>
       A total of
210,000 households have been helped to become homeowners since 2010
with the various measures we have taken.
      </B>
      We intend to go further.
We will do more to help people reach that aspiration of owning their
own home. We will work to deliver that for 1.3 million
housing association tenants, supporting their desire to own their own
home and making sure that at the same time we are boosting the housing
supply in this
country.
